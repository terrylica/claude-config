# SAGE Sync Infrastructure Redesign - Master Plan

## 🎯 **Mission Statement**

Transform SAGE sync from a dangerous file-copying utility into a conversation preservation system with data protection and disaster recovery.

## 📊 **Problem Analysis - Data Loss Incident 2025-08-09**

### Root Cause

- **Primary Failure**: SAGE sync performed destructive `rsync --delete` operation
- **Data Lost**: Complete remote GPU conversation history (unknown quantity)
- **No Recovery**: Zero backup automation, no rollback capability
- **Silent Destruction**: No user warning or confirmation for destructive operation

### Systemic Failures Identified

1. No backup automation before destructive operations
1. No conflict detection or merge intelligence
1. No user confirmation for data loss risk
1. No rollback or disaster recovery capability
1. No session state tracking between environments
1. Tool design treats conversations as disposable files

## 🏗️ **REDESIGNED ARCHITECTURE**

### Core Principles

1. **Data Preservation First**: Never lose conversation history
1. **Merging**: Smart bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
1. **Safety**: Multiple backup layers with verified rollback
1. **User Control**: Clear warnings and confirmation for destructive operations
1. **Session Awareness**: Understand conversation content and context

### Technical Foundation

   - Explicit user acknowledgment for data loss risk
   - Danger warnings with data at risk quantification

1. **Basic Rollback Mechanism**

   - Restore-from-backup functionality
   - Rollback testing automation
   - Backup integrity verification

#### Files to Create/Modify

```
.claude/tools/emergency-backup.sh        # NEW - Safety backup creation
.claude/tools/rollback-restore.sh        # NEW - Emergency restoration
sage-aliases/bin/sage-sync               # MODIFY - Add safety wrapper
```

### 🧠 **PHASE 2: Intelligent Sync Engine (Weeks 2-3) - HIGH**

**Objective**: Replace destructive sync with smart merge

#### Components

1. **Session Metadata System**

   - Session fingerprinting via content hashing
   - Change detection and state tracking
   - Session database with sync states

1. **Conflict Detection Engine**

   - Bidirectional comparison logic
   - Conflict classification (timestamp, content, origin)
   - Dry-run analysis with impact preview

1. **Smart Merge Algorithms**

   - Conversation-aware merging
   - Timestamp-based resolution
   - Interactive conflict resolution

#### Files to Create

```
.claude/lib/session-metadata.sh         # NEW - Session tracking system
.claude/lib/conflict-detection.sh       # NEW - Conflict engine
.claude/lib/smart-merge.sh              # NEW - Merge intelligence
```

### ⚡ **PHASE 3: Additional Features (Weeks 4-5) - MEDIUM**

**Objective**: User experience and control

#### Components

1. **Interactive Conflict Resolution**

   - Conflict resolution UI
   - Session diff viewer
   - Manual merge capabilities

1. **Session Versioning System**

   - Session history tracking
   - Branch-based resolution (keep both variants)
   - Version rollback for individual sessions

1. **Extended Sync Operations**

   - Selective sync (choose specific sessions)
   - Incremental sync (only changed content)
   - Batch conflict resolution

### 🏢 **PHASE 4: Enterprise Resilience (Weeks 6-8) - LOW**

**Objective**: Long-term infrastructure reliability

#### Components

1. **Automated Backup Orchestration**

   - Scheduled backup automation
   - Multiple retention policies
   - Cloud storage integration

1. **Disaster Recovery Testing**

   - Recovery verification automation
   - Health check monitoring
   - Infrastructure resilience testing

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### Session Fingerprinting Algorithm

```bash
generate_session_fingerprint() {
    local session_file="$1"

    # Extract and hash conversation content (ignore metadata)
    session_content=$(jq -r '.messages[] | "\(.timestamp):\(.role):\(.content)"' "$session_file" | sort)

    # Create fingerprint combining content + structure
    echo "$session_content" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
}
```

### Intelligent Sync Operation Flow

```
1. PRE-SYNC SAFETY PROTOCOL
   └── create_emergency_backup() || ABORT
2. SCAN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS
   ├── scan_local_sessions()
   └── scan_remote_sessions()
3. BUILD SYNC PLAN
   ├── analyze_session_differences()
   ├── classify_conflicts()
   └── generate_sync_plan()
4. SHOW IMPACT PREVIEW
   └── display_sync_preview()
5. USER CONFIRMATION
   └── confirm_sync_operations() || CANCEL
6. EXECUTE WITH SAFETY CHECKS
   └── for each operation: execute + verify
7. POST-SYNC VERIFICATION
   ├── verify_sync_integrity()
   ├── update_session_metadata()
   └── cleanup_temporary_files()
```

### Safety Confirmation Protocol

```bash
"🚨 DANGER: DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION DETECTED"
"📋 This will PERMANENTLY OVERWRITE N remote sessions"
"📊 Data at risk: X.X MB of conversation history"
"💾 Automatic backups: ENABLED (verified in 2 locations)"
"🔄 Safer alternative: --merge --interactive"

"🛑 To proceed, type: 'I UNDERSTAND DATA LOSS RISK'"
```
