  title: PID Management psutil Migration
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Migration from custom os.kill-based process detection to industry-standard psutil library.

    Context: bot_utils.py uses os.kill(pid, 0) for stale PID detection, which has edge cases
    (PID reuse, zombie processes). psutil is the industry standard (Docker, AWS CLI, monitoring tools).

    Research: /Users/terryli/.claude/docs/architecture/process-management-tools-research.md

  x-slos:
    availability:
      target: "99.9%"
      metric: "Bot startup success rate (no false PID conflicts)"
      measurement: "Track FileExistsError exceptions where process isn't actually running"

    correctness:
      target: "100%"
      metric: "Accurate process detection (no false positives/negatives)"
      measurement: |
        - Zero false conflicts from PID reuse (unrelated process with same PID)
        - Zero false conflicts from zombie processes
        - Zero missed conflicts from actual running bot instances

    observability:
      target: "100% error visibility"
      metric: "All PID conflicts logged with process details"
      measurement: |
        - Log PID, cmdline, and process status for all conflicts
        - Archive conflict details for post-mortem analysis

    maintainability:
      target: "< 100 lines for PID management"
      metric: "Code complexity and dependency count"
      measurement: |
        - Use established library (psutil) instead of custom logic
        - Clear separation of concerns (detection vs. file management)

  phases:
    phase_1_psutil_integration:
      version: "5.2.0"
      description: "Add psutil dependency and replace os.kill with psutil-based detection"
      scope:
        - Add psutil>=7.0.0 to inline dependencies (PEP 723)
        - Create is_bot_running() helper function
        - Replace os.kill(pid, 0) with psutil.pid_exists()
        - Add cmdline verification to prevent PID reuse
        - Update error messages with process details

      files_modified:
        - /Users/terryli/.claude/automation/lychee/runtime/bot/multi-workspace-bot.py
        - /Users/terryli/.claude/automation/lychee/runtime/lib/bot_utils.py

      validation_criteria:
        - Bot starts successfully with clean PID file
        - Bot detects actual running instance and fails with clear error
        - Bot cleans up stale PID file from dead process
        - Bot handles corrupted PID file gracefully
        - All process conflicts logged with cmdline details

      rollback_plan: "Revert to v5.1.1 (git checkout v5.1.1)"

    phase_2_fcntl_locking:
      version: "5.3.0"
      description: "Optional: Migrate to fcntl-based locking for automatic crash cleanup"
      status: "deferred"
      reason: "Phase 1 sufficient for current use case; fcntl adds fd management complexity"
      scope:
        - Replace O_EXCL file creation with fcntl.flock()
        - Keep file descriptor open for lock lifetime
        - Automatic lock release on crash (kernel cleanup)

      when_to_revisit:
        - Observing stale PID files in production despite psutil checks
        - Deploying to environments with aggressive process killing (containers)
        - Need stronger guarantees for multi-instance prevention

x-implementation-findings:
  phase_1_results:
    version: "5.2.0"
    status: "completed"
    date: "2025-10-29"

    implementation_summary:
      - Added psutil>=7.0.0 to inline dependencies (PEP 723)
      - Created is_bot_running() helper function in bot_utils.py
      - Replaced os.kill(pid, 0) with psutil.pid_exists() + Process.cmdline()
      - Fixed FileExistsError incorrectly caught by (ValueError, IOError) handler
      - Added process details to error messages (PID + command line)

    bug_discovered:
      issue: "FileExistsError re-raised from conflict detection was caught by except (ValueError, IOError) handler"
      root_cause: "IOError is alias for OSError in Python 3; FileExistsError is subclass of OSError"
      fix: "Added explicit except FileExistsError: raise before (ValueError, IOError) handler"
      impact: "Critical - second bot instance would incorrectly start when another was running"

        status: "passed"

    github_release:
      tag: "v5.2.0"
      url: "https://github.com/terrylica/claude-config/releases/tag/v5.2.0"

  current_implementation_analysis:
    strengths:
      - Atomic creation with O_CREAT | O_EXCL (correct approach)
      - Stale PID detection implemented (os.kill signal 0)
      - Proper cleanup on graceful exit
      - Race condition awareness (v5.1.1 fix)

    edge_cases:
      - pid_reuse: "New unrelated process could have same PID as dead bot"
      - zombie_processes: "os.kill(pid, 0) returns True for zombie processes"
      - access_denied: "No verification that PID belongs to our bot"

    migration_rationale:
      - psutil is industry standard (Docker, AWS CLI, monitoring tools)
      - Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
      - Actively maintained (v7.1.3, 2024)
      - Better than os.kill - provides process metadata
      - Can verify process identity via cmdline

      description: "Bot starts with PID file where process is zombie"
      expected: "Detects zombie status via psutil.Process.status(), treats as stale"

x-rollout:
  strategy: "Feature flag with validation"
  steps:
    - Implement psutil-based detection in bot_utils.py
    - Add comprehensive logging for all code paths
    - Test all scenarios (clean, conflict, stale, reuse, corrupted)
    - Validate bot restarts cleanly with file edits (watchexec)
    - Tag v5.2.0 and create GitHub release

  rollback_triggers:
    - Bot fails to start with clean PID file
    - False positives (bot kills itself when it's the only instance)
    - False negatives (bot starts when another instance is running)
    - Increased crash rate or errors in production
