# Intent Over Implementation
intent:
  problem: |
    Multi-account GitHub authentication requires directory-aware automatic
    account selection without manual intervention. User maintains 3 GitHub
    accounts (tainora, terrylica, 459ecs) mapped to distinct project directories.
    Manual gh auth switch creates workflow friction.

  constraints:
    - Must work seamlessly across multiple macOS machines
    - Cannot compromise existing directory-based SSH config Match directives
    - Zero workflow friction requirement (git operations must work transparently)
    - Passphrase protection non-negotiable for offline key security

  decision_rationale: |
    Option 1b (SSH + Doppler Shared Keys) chosen over:
    - 1a: Eliminated cross-machine sync burden (manual SCP/rsync)
    - 1c: Rejected due to 6-7hr implementation overhead for marginal security gain
         (Doppler token compromise exposes all secrets, not just SSH keys)
    - 2: HTTPS requires manual gh auth switch per directory transition

    Analysis: /tmp/option-1b-vs-1c-complexity-analysis.md

# Abstractions Over Details
architecture:
  pattern: "SSH + Doppler Shared Keys (Option 1b)"
  alternative_patterns_considered:
    - "SSH + Unique Keys Per Machine (Option 1a) - manual sync burden"
    - "SSH + Doppler Ephemeral Mounting (Option 1c) - 150+ LOC, 3-4hr setup"
    - "HTTPS + gh CLI Auto-Switch (Option 2) - manual account switching"

  key_invariants:
    - "Directory pattern /459ecs triggers 459ecs account selection"
    - "SSH config Match directive: exec 'echo $PWD | grep -q /459ecs'"
    - "Passphrase protection maintained across all machines"
    - "Single Source of Truth: Doppler claude-config/dev"

# Version Tracking
evolution:
  v1_0_0:
    date: "2025-10-16"
    change: "Initial Doppler migration from local-only SSH keys"
    trigger: "Cross-machine maintenance burden identified during git push auth failure"
    decision_doc: "/tmp/option-1b-vs-1c-complexity-analysis.md"
    complexity_tradeoff: "1b: 20 LOC vs 1c: 150+ LOC - 6-7hr savings"

# Cross-Machine Context
deployment:
  sync_mechanism: "~/.local/bin/sync-ssh-keys"
  target_location: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519_459ecs"
  file_permissions: "600 (SSH enforced)"

  integration_points:
    ssh_config: |
      Match host github.com exec "echo $PWD | grep -q '/459ecs'"
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_459ecs

    git_config: |
      # Note: 459ecs may use default or includeIf configuration
      # Verify via git config user.name in /459ecs directories

# Usage Context
usage:
  account: "459ecs"
  organization: "Client projects"
  directory_pattern: "/459ecs"
  primary_repositories:
    - "Client-specific repositories"
    - "Consulting projects"
  activation_trigger: "Working directory contains '/459ecs' substring"

# Security Properties
security:
  passphrase_protected: true
  algorithm: "ed25519"
  key_rotation_policy: "On-demand (compromise, security upgrade, annual audit)"
  threat_model: |
    Primary: Personal machine compromise
    Defense: Passphrase provides last-line protection
  risk_acceptance: |
    Doppler token compromise exposes ALL secrets (SSH, Pushover, PyPI, AWS).
    Accepted because Option 1c (ephemeral mounting) has equivalent token exposure
    with 6-7hr complexity overhead and no additional security for this threat model.

# Maintenance
maintenance:
  sync_procedure: "Run sync-ssh-keys on new machine or after key rotation"
  test_procedure: |
    cd ~/459ecs && git clone git@github.com:459ecs/test-repo.git
    Expected: Automatic 459ecs account selection, no manual auth required
  monitoring: "Manual verification via git operations in /459ecs directories"
  rotation_trigger: "Suspected compromise, passphrase change, annual review"
