## v1.0.10 (2025-10-08)

### 🔬 Feature Validation & Refinement

- **Refined tail risk features based on IC validation** (QUALITY IMPROVEMENT)
  - Removed `rsi_shock_5bar` (-70.1% IC loss vs source feature `rsi_change_5`)
  - Removed `rsi_acceleration` (-34.9% IC loss vs source feature `rsi_velocity`)
  - Validated `rsi_shock_1bar` (+18.6% IC gain) and `rsi_volatility_spike` (+40.7% IC gain)
  - Retained `extreme_regime_persistence` and `tail_risk_score` (composite features)
  - Updated `tail_risk_score` formula with reweighted components (0.4, 0.3, 0.3)

  **Methodology**: Out-of-sample IC validation on 3,276 bars (BTCUSDT 2h, 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-30)
  **Decision threshold**: IC gain > +5% to KEEP, < -5% to DROP

### 📊 Feature Counts

- **Per-interval features**: 33 → **31** (-2 features)
- **Multi-interval unfiltered**: 139 → **133** (-6 features across 3 intervals)
- **Multi-interval filtered (default)**: 91 → **85** (-6 features)
- **Single-interval**: 33 → **31** (-2 features)

**What users get by default**:
- `ATRAdaptiveLaguerreRSIConfig.multi_interval()` → **85 features** (filter_redundancy=True)
- `ATRAdaptiveLaguerreRSIConfig.multi_interval(filter_redundancy=False)` → **133 features**
- `ATRAdaptiveLaguerreRSIConfig.single_interval()` → **31 features**

### ✅ Validation

- Confirmed IC gains for kept features on out-of-sample data
- Validated non-anticipative guarantee for 31-feature pipeline
- All tests passing with updated feature counts
- Redundancy filtering unchanged (48 features removed, threshold |ρ| > 0.9)

## v1.0.6 (2025-10-07)

### 🎯 UX Improvements

- **Added runtime warning for single-interval mode** (CRITICAL UX IMPROVEMENT)
  - Users now warned when using default config (27 features)
  - Clear guidance to use `.multi_interval()` for 79 features
  - Warning explains missing 31 cross-interval analysis features
  - Prevents users from unknowingly missing powerful features

  **Impact**: Helps users discover multi-interval mode (79 features) instead of getting only single-interval mode (27 features)

- **Reorganized README to prominently feature multi-interval mode**
  - Multi-interval mode (79 features) now shown first as recommended
  - Added "Feature Modes" comparison table
  - Clear explanation of 31 cross-interval features
  - Single-interval mode clearly marked as "minimal lookback" use case

### 📚 Documentation

- Added feature mode comparison section to README
- Clarified that multi-interval mode is recommended for ML pipelines
- Listed cross-interval features: regime alignment, divergence detection, momentum cascades
- Reorganized Quick Start to show multi-interval first

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Thank you to Eon Labs ML Feature Engineering team for identifying this critical UX issue
- The feedback revealed that users were unknowingly missing 52 powerful features (79 total vs 27)
- Multi-interval mode includes 31 cross-interval analysis features unavailable in single-interval mode

## v1.0.5 (2025-10-07)

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

- **Fixed data leakage in mult1/mult2 intervals at boundary conditions** (CRITICAL)
  - v1.0.4 introduced a boundary condition bug when validation times aligned exactly with resampled bar timestamps
  - **Root cause**: Used `np.searchsorted(..., side='right')` which incorrectly included bars with `availability == base_time`
  - **Fix**: Changed to `side='left'` to ensure strict inequality (`availability < base_time`)
  - **Impact**: Prevents future data leakage at specific timestamps (25% failure rate in v1.0.4)

  **Details**:
  - When a mult1 resampled bar's availability time equals validation time, that bar should be **excluded** (not available yet)
  - v1.0.4 incorrectly included it due to `searchsorted` boundary semantics
  - Example: At validation time 04:00:00, mult1 bar at 04:00:00 (ready 06:00:00) was incorrectly used
  - v1.0.5 correctly uses previous bar (20:00:00, ready 22:00:00)

  **Validation**:
  - All 41 tests pass
  - Boundary condition test confirms no leakage at critical timestamps
  - No performance regression (still 54x faster than v1.0.3)

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Thank you to the user who discovered this critical bug through comprehensive validation testing
- The detailed bug report with specific failing timestamps enabled rapid diagnosis and fix
- This highlights the importance of testing at exact boundary conditions, not just random timestamps

## v1.0.4 (2025-10-07)

### ⚠️ Note

**This version has a CRITICAL DATA LEAKAGE BUG at boundary conditions.**
The bug occurs when validation times align exactly with mult1/mult2 resampled bar timestamps (25% failure rate).
**Use v1.0.5 instead, which fixes the searchsorted boundary condition bug.**

### ⚡ Performance

- **54x faster than v1.0.3 - TRUE vectorized implementation!**
  - Finally achieved production-ready performance
  - 1K rows: 16.46s (v1.0.3) → **0.30s** (v1.0.4) = **54x faster**
  - Estimated 32K rows: ~10-15 seconds (vs 51 minutes in v1.0.3!)

  **What was wrong in v1.0.3**:
  - Still used row-by-row `.loc` assignment (very slow in pandas)
  - Binary search in Python loop instead of vectorized numpy

  **What's fixed in v1.0.4**:
  - Fully vectorized using `np.searchsorted` (numpy binary search)
  - Vectorized assignment using `.iloc[indices].values`
  - No Python loops for assignment

  **Complexity**: O(n + m log m) where m << n (resampled bars)

### 📚 Documentation

- Acknowledged that v1.0.3 did not deliver promised performance improvements
- User feedback was correct: v1.0.3 performance was identical to v1.0.2

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Thank you to the user who provided detailed performance profiling showing v1.0.3 was no faster than v1.0.2
- The rigorous testing (360, 500, 1K, 32K rows) revealed the issue
- v1.0.4 implements the ACTUAL optimization that was intended for v1.0.3

## v1.0.3 (2025-10-07)

### ⚠️ Note

**This version did not achieve the claimed performance improvements.**
User testing revealed v1.0.3 was identical in performance to v1.0.2 (~6s for 500 rows, still timed out on 32K rows).
The issue was row-by-row pandas `.loc` assignment which is extremely slow.
**Use v1.0.4 instead, which delivers the true 50x+ speedup.**

### ⚡ Performance

- **8.2x faster than v1.0.1, 3.4x faster than v1.0.2!**
  - Pre-compute resampled data ONCE instead of per-row
  - Binary search for availability mapping (O(log m) instead of O(m))
  - 500 rows: 13.86s (v1.0.1) → 5.83s (v1.0.2) → **1.69s** (v1.0.3)
  - Estimated 32K rows: ~15 min → ~2 min → **~20 sec**

  **Technical improvements**:
  1. Resample full dataset once upfront (O(n))
  2. Compute availability time for each resampled bar (O(m))
  3. Binary search to find available bars (O(n log m))
  4. Total complexity: **O(n log m)** vs O(n²) in v1.0.1

  **Impact**: Now truly production-ready for large datasets!

## v1.0.2 (2025-10-07)

### ⚡ Performance

- **5.4x faster `availability_column` processing**
  - Optimized from O(n²) to O(n) with intelligent caching
  - 500 rows: 13.86s → 2.56s (5.4x faster)
  - 32K rows: ~15 min → ~15 sec (estimated 60x faster)

  **Before (v1.0.1)**: Naive row-by-row filtering + resampling
  **After (v1.0.2)**: Incremental index tracking + feature caching

  Technical improvements:
  - Only resample when new data becomes available
  - Cache resampled features and reuse when possible
  - Incremental availability index advancement

  **Impact**: Production-ready performance for large datasets

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated `_fit_transform_features_with_availability` docstring with performance notes
- Added validation check for sorted `availability_column` (required for O(n) optimization)

## v1.0.1 (2025-10-07)

### ✨ Features

- **Fix Critical Data Leakage in Multi-Interval Mode**
  - Added `availability_column` parameter to `ATRAdaptiveLaguerreRSIConfig`
  - When set, multi-interval resampling respects temporal availability constraints
  - Prevents data leakage by ensuring only "available" resampled bars are used
  - Required for production ML with delayed data availability (e.g., exchange delays)

  **Usage**:
  ```python
  config = ATRAdaptiveLaguerreRSIConfig.multi_interval(
      multiplier_1=4,
      multiplier_2=12,
      availability_column='actual_ready_time'  # NEW
  )
  ```

  **Impact**: Eliminates 71% leakage in 4x features, 14% in 12x features

- **Added 5 test cases** for `availability_column` validation
  - No data leakage with availability constraints
  - Works with realistic data delays
  - Clear error messages for missing columns
  - Compatible with redundancy filtering

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Multi-interval data leakage** (CRITICAL): Fixed resampling logic that used future bars
  - Root cause: Resampling entire dataset created bars with future base bars
  - Fix: Row-by-row processing when `availability_column` is set
  - Validation: Full data vs prediction data features now match exactly

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated factory method docstring to document `availability_column`
- Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_features/test_availability_column.py`

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Enable redundancy filtering by default (121→79 features) BREAKING CHANGE: filter_redundancy now defaults to True instead of False. Multi-interval configurations now return 79 features by default (was 121). - Added RedundancyFilter module (removes 42 features with |ρ| > 0.9) - IC validation passed: +45.54% improvement, -0.52% |IC| change - Updated documentation and added 15 test cases - Created specifications: redundancy-filter-v1.1.0.yaml Migration: Set filter_redundancy=False to restore v0.2.x behavior (121 features) Resolves: Feature dimensionality reduction without sacrificing predictive power [**breaking**]
