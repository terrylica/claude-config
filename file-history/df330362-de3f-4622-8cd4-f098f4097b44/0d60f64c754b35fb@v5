# Lessons Learned
lessons_learned:
  - issue: "Regime detection drops rows with small datasets"
    root_cause: "Rolling calculations require lookback_window bars of history, then drop_nulls() removes NaN rows"
    solution: "For testing: use smaller lookback_window. For production: 175K bars >> lookback_window=24"
    impact: "Synthetic test data needs 50+ bars for meaningful testing with default lookback"

  - issue: "Transformer nested tensor warning"
    root_cause: "PyTorch internal optimization disabled when norm_first=True"
    solution: "Benign warning, no action needed"
    impact: "None (performance hint only)"

  - issue: "Production data not available on all machines"
    root_cause: "Range bar generation happened on Terry's Mac, not synced to yca"
    solution: "Document data transfer steps in implementation plan"

  - issue: "Model overconfidence prevents conformal coverage guarantees"
    discovered: "2025-10-04"
    root_cause: |
      Model trained with standard cross-entropy produces overly peaked probability distributions.
      Softmax outputs are near one-hot (prediction set size = 1.0 always).
      ECE low (0.0464) but conformal prediction exposes systematic overconfidence.
    impact: "CRITICAL - Cannot deploy without coverage guarantees (gap 32.2% >> 5% tolerance)"
    solution_options:
      - "Temperature scaling: logits/T where T>1 reduces peakedness"
      - "Label smoothing during training: targets = (1-α)·one_hot + α/K"
      - "Focal loss: focuses on hard examples, reduces overconfidence"
      - "Ensemble methods: average predictions from multiple models"
      - "Mixup/CutMix data augmentation during training"
    recommended: "Temperature scaling (fastest, no retraining)"
    technical_note: |
      ECE measures binned calibration but can miss systematic overconfidence.
      Conformal prediction requires well-calibrated uncertainties for coverage.
      This finding demonstrates the value of distribution-free guarantees.
    impact: "Training blocked until data available"
