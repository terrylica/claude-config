    date: "2025-10-04"
    outcome: |
      Dependencies installed successfully via uv pip install
      Packages: torch, polars, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, tqdm, tensorboard, matplotlib, seaborn, einops
      Total packages: 38
      Environment: /home/yca/eon/rangebar/.venv (Python 3.13.7)

  validate-002_imports:
    status: "passed"
    date: "2025-10-04"
    outcome: |
      All imports resolve correctly
      Verified: RangeBarDataset, OODRobustRangeBarModel
      Method: sys.path.insert(0, 'research/ml_ood')

  validate-003_data_loading:
    status: "passed_with_synthetic_data"
    date: "2025-10-04"
    outcome: |
      Synthetic data: 50 bars generated
      Dataset created: 25 valid samples (sequence_len=5, regime_lookback=10)
      Schema validated: Fixed-point conversion working
      Regime detection: Working (requires lookback adjustment for small datasets)

      SOLUSDT range bar data successfully generated on yca machine

      Resolution: Rebuilt rangebar-export without statistics feature (avoided OOM), generated locally

    original_issue:
      - Data initially missing (only existed on Terry's Mac)
      - First generation attempt failed silently at day ~850 due to memory exhaustion
      - Root cause: statistics feature loads all 424M trades into memory (16GB+ RAM)

# Lessons Learned
lessons_learned:
  - issue: "Regime detection drops rows with small datasets"
    root_cause: "Rolling calculations require lookback_window bars of history, then drop_nulls() removes NaN rows"
    solution: "For testing: use smaller lookback_window. For production: 175K bars >> lookback_window=24"
    impact: "Synthetic test data needs 50+ bars for meaningful testing with default lookback"

  - issue: "Transformer nested tensor warning"
    root_cause: "PyTorch internal optimization disabled when norm_first=True"
    solution: "Benign warning, no action needed"
    impact: "None (performance hint only)"

  - issue: "Production data not available on all machines"
    root_cause: "Range bar generation happened on Terry's Mac, not synced to yca"
    solution: "Document data transfer steps in implementation plan"
    impact: "Training blocked until data available"
