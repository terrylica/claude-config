# Technical Audit Report: Victor's Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategy

**Auditor:** Terry Li (Engineering Lead)
**Subject:** Victor Hogrefre (CBO) - OKX Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategy
**Audit Date:** September 30, 2025
**Scripts Reviewed:**
- `funding_arb_strat_1.py` (v8)
- `pull_funding_arb_hist.py` (v8)
- `next_funding_rate.py` (v2.3)

---

## Executive Summary

Victor's funding rate arbitrage strategy demonstrates exceptional backtest results (7,708% APY, Sharpe 19.48) over a 94-day period. The code is well-structured with sophisticated rebalancing logic and fee modeling. However, **critical security issues and implementation discrepancies require immediate attention before production deployment.**

**Overall Assessment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** - Strategy logic is sound, but security and configuration issues must be resolved.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. **Hardcoded API Credentials in Source Code**
**File:** `pull_funding_arb_hist.py` (lines 72-74)
**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY**

```python
OKX_API_KEY = os.getenv("7abc4982-7def-4151-b4e8-775617b8e0cf")
OKX_API_SECRET = os.getenv("8B557B7D8F48C150624C868028161EB3")
OKX_API_PASSPHRASE = os.getenv("KNs36Tx7FW97XwY!")
```

**Issues:**
- API key, secret, and passphrase are passed as **literal strings** to `os.getenv()` instead of environment variable names
- This means the code will never actually retrieve credentials from the environment
- If the intention was to use env vars, the correct usage should be:
  ```python
  OKX_API_KEY = os.getenv("OKX_API_KEY")  # Retrieves value of $OKX_API_KEY
  OKX_API_SECRET = os.getenv("OKX_API_SECRET")
  OKX_API_PASSPHRASE = os.getenv("OKX_API_PASSPHRASE")
  ```
- **Exposed credentials:** These appear to be actual API credentials that are now committed to git history

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# 1. Immediately rotate/invalidate these API credentials on OKX
# 2. Remove from git history (use git-filter-repo or BFG Repo-Cleaner)
# 3. Implement proper credential management (see user's Doppler spec in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
# 4. Update code to use Doppler CLI or proper env vars
```

**Proper implementation:**
```python
# Using Doppler (per user's specifications)
# Run script as: doppler run -- python pull_funding_arb_hist.py

OKX_API_KEY = os.getenv("OKX_API_KEY")
OKX_API_SECRET = os.getenv("OKX_API_SECRET")
OKX_API_PASSPHRASE = os.getenv("OKX_API_PASSPHRASE")

if not all([OKX_API_KEY, OKX_API_SECRET, OKX_API_PASSPHRASE]):
    print("WARNING: OKX API credentials not found. Running in public-only mode.")
```

### 2. **Weight Constraint Discrepancy**
**File:** `funding_arb_strat_1.py` (line 40)
**Severity:** üü° **HIGH** (Configuration Mismatch)

**Victor's Chat Specification:**
> "Weights: min 5%, max 50% per symbol; sum to 100%."

**Code Comment (line 9):**
> "MAX_W = 0.70 (no symbol > 70%)"

**Actual Code Value (line 40):**
```python
MAX_W = 0.50     # max 70%  ‚Üê Comment is WRONG
```

**Analysis:**
- The actual value `0.50` (50%) matches Victor's specification
- The comment `# max 70%` is **incorrect** and misleading
- This could cause confusion during future modifications

**Recommendation:**
```python
MAX_W = 0.50     # max 50% per symbol (per strategy spec)
```

---

## üü° HIGH-PRIORITY OBSERVATIONS

### 3. **Backtest Period Anomaly**
**Finding:** 94-day backtest shows 7,708% APY (19.48 Sharpe)

**Questions for Victor:**
1. **Time period validation:**
   - Specified dates are in the **future** (2025-06-25 ‚Üí 2025-09-27)
   - Was this a typo? Should it be 2024?
   - Or is this a forward-looking simulation using projected rates?

2. **Return decomposition:**
   - What % of returns came from positive vs. negative funding?
   - How many rebalances were executed vs. skipped due to gates?
   - Turnover statistics?

3. **Market regime:**
   - Were funding rates unusually volatile during this period?
   - How does performance compare across different market conditions?

**Recommendation:** Request detailed backtest breakdown and sensitivity analysis.

---

### 4. **Data Limitation Acknowledgment**
**File:** `pull_funding_arb_hist.py` (lines 5-12)

Victor correctly documents that OKX's public API only provides **3 months** of historical data:

```python
# The OKX REST endpoint **Get funding rate history** only returns
# **up to three months** of data total.
```

**Implication for 94-day backtest:**
- ‚úÖ Falls within 3-month API window - data is valid
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot extend backtest further without bulk historical data

**Recommendation:** For longer-term validation, suggest:
- Download OKX's bulk historical funding rate CSV (available from 2021)
- Implement the optional CSV importer Victor mentioned (line 205-211)

---

### 5. **Fee Model Assumptions**
**Finding:** Assumes 60% maker execution rate

```python
MAKER_RATIO = 0.60  # 60% maker, 40% taker
```

**Questions:**
1. **Validation:** Is 60/40 maker/taker ratio realistic for this strategy?
   - Market-neutral arbitrage typically uses limit orders (high maker ratio)
   - But funding arbitrage requires precise timing at settlement
   - What's the actual execution analysis from Victor's research?

2. **VIP-7 tier:** Does the account actually have VIP-7 status?
   - Requires $50M+ in 30-day trading volume
   - Or $10M+ in holdings
   - Confirm eligibility before assuming VIP-7 fees

3. **Slippage:** Fee model doesn't include slippage
   - Especially important for large positions
   - Consider adding slippage assumptions

**Recommendation:**
- Validate maker ratio through exchange execution reports
- Add slippage buffer (e.g., 2-5 bps) to fee model
- Test strategy with VIP-0 fees to understand fee sensitivity

---

### 6. **Leverage Model Inconsistency**
**Finding:** `next_funding_rate.py` uses 12x leverage, but `funding_arb_strat_1.py` doesn't

**`next_funding_rate.py` (lines 50-53):**
```python
L_SPOT_LEVERAGE = 12.0
BORROWED_SHARE = 12/13 ‚âà 0.92308  # 92.3% borrowed
EQUITY_SHARE   = 1/13  ‚âà 0.07692  # 7.7% equity
```

**`funding_arb_strat_1.py`:**
- No leverage modeling
- Assumes 1:1 notional matching (unlevered)

**Questions:**
1. Are these two scripts modeling **different strategies**?
   - Portfolio backtester: Unlevered absolute value strategy?
   - Real-time signal: Leveraged implementation?

2. How do backtested returns scale with leverage?
   - 7,708% APY on 1x leverage ‚Üí ~100,000% APY on 12x?
   - Or does backtester already assume leverage implicitly?

**Recommendation:** Clarify leverage assumptions and reconcile the two implementations.

---

## üü¢ POSITIVE FINDINGS (Well-Implemented)

### 7. **Sophisticated Rebalancing Logic**
‚úÖ **Excellent implementation** of multi-gate rebalancing:
- Min-hold period prevents overtrading
- Hurdle filter ensures meaningful edges
- Value-vs-cost gate prevents negative-value trades
- No-trade bands reduce noise

**Code Quality:** Clean, readable, well-documented

---

### 8. **Deterministic Weight Allocation**
‚úÖ **Robust allocator** (`capped_topk_weights_minmax` function):
- Handles edge cases (fewer than k symbols, min/max constraint conflicts)
- Deterministic and reproducible
- Proper normalization to sum=1

---

### 9. **Comprehensive Fee Modeling**
‚úÖ **Sophisticated fee calculation**:
- Blended maker/taker fees
- Turnover-based scaling
- Both spot and perp legs accounted for
- VIP-7 tier properly modeled

---

### 10. **Premium-Index Tracking** (next_funding_rate.py)
‚úÖ **Advanced estimation logic**:
- Weighted moving average of recent premium samples
- Fallback to current premium if no history
- Proper interest rate adjustment
- Multiple API endpoint fallbacks

---

## üìä VALIDATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Security Audit:**
   - [ ] Rotate compromised API credentials
   - [ ] Implement Doppler credential management
   - [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done)
   - [ ] Scan git history for leaked secrets

2. **Backtest Validation:**
   - [ ] Clarify actual backtest period (2024 vs 2025?)
   - [ ] Run walk-forward analysis (out-of-sample testing)
   - [ ] Stress test with different market regimes
   - [ ] Compare results to buy-and-hold funding capture

3. **Parameter Sensitivity:**
   - [ ] Test different TOP_K values (3, 5, 7, 10)
   - [ ] Test different MIN_W/MAX_W constraints
   - [ ] Test different rebalancing cadences
   - [ ] Test fee sensitivity (VIP-0 through VIP-7)

4. **Implementation Reconciliation:**
   - [ ] Clarify leverage assumptions
   - [ ] Align fee models between scripts
   - [ ] Document expected turnover and frequency

5. **Live Testing:**
   - [ ] Paper trade for 2-4 weeks
   - [ ] Compare live execution to backtest assumptions
   - [ ] Validate maker/taker ratios
   - [ ] Measure actual slippage

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Week):
1. **Rotate OKX API credentials** (exposed in git)
2. Fix weight constraint comment mismatch
3. Implement Doppler credential management
4. Clarify backtest period with Victor

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Extended backtest validation (different periods)
2. Parameter sensitivity analysis
3. Leverage model reconciliation
4. Paper trading setup

### Before Live Deployment:
1. Legal/compliance review of arbitrage strategy
2. Exchange account VIP tier confirmation
3. Risk management system integration
4. Kill-switch and monitoring implementation

---

## CONCLUSION

Victor's strategy demonstrates strong theoretical foundations and impressive backtest results. The code quality is high, with sophisticated rebalancing logic and fee modeling. However, **immediate security remediation is required** before any production deployment.

The strategy's extraordinarily high returns (7,708% APY) warrant additional scrutiny:
- Validate across longer time periods
- Test under different market regimes
- Confirm results with independent data sources
- Implement robust risk management before live trading

**Recommendation:** Proceed with production development contingent on:
1. Security issues resolved
2. Extended validation completed
3. Paper trading successful
