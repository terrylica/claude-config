# Temporal Audit Status Summary

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Auditor:** Terry Li
**Subject:** Victor's OKX Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategies

---

## 📊 Audit Status Overview

| Strategy | File | Look-Ahead Bias? | Backtest Found? | Status |
|----------|------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Portfolio (No Leverage)** | `funding_arb_strat_1.py` | ✅ **CONFIRMED** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ **Bias Detected** |
| **Leverage Strategy** | `next_funding_rate.py` | ❓ **UNCLEAR** | ❌ **NO** | ⚠️ **Needs Verification** |

---

## 🔍 Strategy #1: Portfolio Strategy (No Leverage)

### File: `funding_arb_strat_1.py`

**Victor's Statement:**
> "Yeah, good catch for the first two files for the first approach, there is a temporal violation, because i just took the history of funding rates, and just used the funding rates as though i had known them at the time."

**Audit Findings:** ✅ **CONFIRMED**

- **Look-ahead bias:** Present (lines 183-223)
- **Impact:** 5.4 pp APY difference (75.61% → 70.25%)
- **Corrected version:** Created (`funding_arb_strat_corrected.py`)
- **Strategy framework:** Excellent (validated)
- **Recommendation:** Use corrected backtester for deployment

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** — Issue identified, corrected, and documented.

---

## 🔍 Strategy #2: Leverage Strategy

### File: `next_funding_rate.py`

**Victor's Statement:**
> "The second strategy there, the one that uses the leverage, that doesn't have the look-ahead bias, because it basically it uses okx's own formula to calculate or estimate the next funding rate, it looks at the last funding rate, and then estimates the next funding rate based on the formula that okx provides."

**Audit Findings:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**

### ✅ What We Verified (Prediction Logic)

| Component | Status | Finding |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Premium history data | ✅ PASS | Uses only historical data (no future leakage) |
| OKX formula | ✅ PASS | Correctly implemented, publicly available |
| Real-time scanner | ✅ PASS | Temporally correct, production-ready |
| 3-day realized performance | ✅ PASS | Uses historical settled rates only |

**Conclusion:** The **prediction logic** is temporally correct and uses only information available at decision time.

### ❌ What We Could NOT Verify (Backtest)

**Critical Issue:** `next_funding_rate.py` is a **live prediction tool**, not a backtester.

**What's missing:**
- ❌ No backtest implementation found
- ❌ Cannot verify historical performance claims
- ❌ Cannot validate prediction accuracy over time
- ❌ Cannot confirm absence of temporal violations in trading logic

**Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** — Prediction logic verified, but backtest missing.

## 🎯 Critical Questions for Victor

### Question 1: Where is the backtest for the leverage strategy?

**Context:** `next_funding_rate.py` only generates predictions in real-time. To validate that the strategy doesn't have look-ahead bias, we need to see:

1. **A backtest script** that:
   - Uses historical data to simulate predictions at T-1
   - Applies actual settled rates at T for returns
   - Calculates performance metrics (APY, Sharpe, etc.)

2. **Performance results:**
   - What APY did the leverage strategy achieve?
   - What was the Sharpe ratio?
   - What time period was tested?

**Possible answers:**
- ✅ "Here's the backtest file: [path]"
- ⚠️ "I ran it manually in a notebook"
- ❌ "I don't have a formal backtest yet"

### Question 2: How accurate are the predictions?

**Context:** Even with temporally correct prediction logic, the strategy only works if predictions have edge.

**Need to validate:**
1. **Correlation:** Predicted vs actual rates (should be > 0.3)
2. **Mean absolute error:** Average prediction error (should be < 10 bps)
3. **Directional accuracy:** % of correct sign predictions (should be > 60%)

**Can Victor provide:**
- Historical prediction vs actual rate comparison?
- Accuracy metrics over time?
- Evidence that predictions outperform naive baselines?

### Question 3: Has this been live traded?

**Context:** Live trading results would validate that the strategy works without look-ahead bias.

**Questions:**
1. Has the leverage strategy been paper traded?
   - If yes, what were the results?
   - How do they compare to backtest predictions?

2. Has it been live traded with real money?
   - If yes, what's the actual performance?
   - Any divergence from backtest expectations?

3. If not live traded yet:
   - Why not?
   - What's blocking deployment?

## 🔬 Why This Matters

### The Distinction: Prediction vs Backtest

**Victor's statement is correct that:**
- ✅ The prediction method uses OKX's formula (temporally correct)
- ✅ The formula is public and available in real-time
- ✅ No future data is used in predictions

**However, this does NOT automatically mean:**
- ❓ The backtest is free of look-ahead bias
- ❓ The strategy performs as claimed historically
- ❓ The predictions are accurate enough to be profitable

### Example of Subtle Bias

Even with correct prediction logic, a backtest can still have hidden bias:

```python
# Prediction is correct (uses T-1 data)
predicted_rate = estimate_using_okx_formula(premium_history_T_minus_1)

# But then...
actual_rate = get_actual_rate(T)  # You know this now!

# Decision uses actual rate instead of predicted (WRONG!)
if actual_rate > break_even:  # ← Look-ahead bias!
    enter_position()

# Returns use actual rate (correct)
pnl = calculate_pnl(actual_rate)
```

The prediction itself is fine, but the **decision logic** uses future information.

## 📋 What We Need from Victor

### To Complete the Audit

1. **Backtest Code**
   - Location of backtest script for leverage strategy
   - If doesn't exist, we can build one using the prediction logic

2. **Performance Claims**
   - Exact APY, Sharpe, drawdown metrics
   - Time period tested
   - Number of trades executed

3. **Prediction Accuracy Data**
   - Historical predictions vs actual rates
   - Correlation, MAE, directional accuracy
   - Evidence of predictive edge

4. **Live Trading Evidence** (if available)
   - Paper trading results
   - Real money results
   - Comparison to backtest predictions

### Three Possible Outcomes

**Scenario A: Backtest Exists and is Clean**
- ✅ Review backtest code
- ✅ Verify temporal correctness
- ✅ Reproduce results
- ✅ Proceed with deployment

**Scenario B: Backtest Exists but Has Issues**
- ⚠️ Identify temporal violations
- ⚠️ Correct the backtest
- ⚠️ Re-run and compare results
- ⚠️ Adjust expectations

**Scenario C: No Backtest Exists**
- 🔨 Build backtest using prediction logic
- 🔨 Test on historical data
- 🔨 Validate prediction accuracy
- 🔨 Determine if strategy has edge

## 💬 How to Present This to Victor

### Option 1: Direct Questions

**"Hey Victor, quick questions about the leverage strategy:**

1. Where's the backtest script for `next_funding_rate.py`?
2. What APY did it achieve historically?
3. Do you have prediction accuracy data?

**I verified the prediction logic is temporally correct, but need to see the backtest to complete the audit."**

### Option 2: Collaborative Approach

**"Victor, I've completed the temporal audit on your strategies:**

**Portfolio strategy:** Found look-ahead bias (as you mentioned), corrected it. Results: 75.61% → 70.25% APY. Ready for deployment with corrected version.

**Leverage strategy:** Your prediction logic is solid—no temporal violations. However, I couldn't find the backtest implementation.

**Can we:**
1. Review the backtest together if you have it?
2. Or I can build one using your prediction logic to validate performance?

**Either way, I want to make sure we can deploy this with confidence."**

### Option 3: Offer to Help

**"Victor, audit update:**

The prediction method in `next_funding_rate.py` is temporally correct—good design choice using OKX's public formula.

**To complete the validation, I need to:**
- See the backtest that tests this strategy historically
- Validate prediction accuracy over time
- Confirm performance claims

**If you don't have a formal backtest yet, I can build one this week. Would that be helpful?"**
