# OOD Trading Profit - Gaps Summary

**Goal**: OOD robust trading profit via rolling window walk-forward analysis
**Current Readiness**: 45%

---

## 🎯 What You Have (Strong Foundation)

✅ **Temporal Validation** - validation/walk_forward/, core_lib/validation/
✅ **Trading Fitness Metrics** - features/fitness/ (MFE/MAE, directional trading)
✅ **Microstructure Features** - features/microstructure/ (5 SOTA modules)
✅ **Regime Detection** - features/cycleness/ (market regime classification)
✅ **Data Pipeline** - data_pipeline/ (Binance + gap filling)
✅ **Zero-Magic-Number Principles** - Data-driven parameters throughout
✅ **Trading Strategy Roadmap** - docs/roadmap/parameterless_adaptive_trading_strategy.md

## 🚨 What You're Missing (Critical Gaps)

❌ **Backtesting Framework**
   - Status: Mentioned in CLAUDE.md but NOT installed
   - Need: `pip install backtesting`
   - Impact: Can't test trading profit at all

❌ **OOD Robustness Testing**
   - Status: No distribution shift detection
   - Need: KL divergence, Wasserstein distance, regime-conditional testing
   - Impact: Can't verify OOD robustness

❌ **Trading Profit Metrics**
   - Status: Have MFE/MAE but not Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar
   - Need: Profit-based optimization (not MAE-based)
   - Impact: Optimizing for prediction accuracy, not trading profit

❌ **Position Sizing & Risk Management**
   - Status: No position sizing or stop-loss logic
   - Need: Kelly criterion, volatility-based sizing, stops
   - Impact: Unrealistic backtest results

❌ **Transaction Cost Modeling**
   - Status: No fees or slippage in backtests
   - Need: Maker/taker fees (0.075%/0.1%), slippage
   - Impact: Inflated profit estimates

## 🗑️ What to Prune

**docs/ideas_brewing/** (29 Python files, all stale since Sep 15):
- ❌ Synthetic data generator research → NOT aligned with real trading
- ❌ Generator quality evaluation → Academic exercise, not profit-focused
- ❌ Training optimization experiments → GPU experiments, not trading
- ⚠️ Realistic market simulation → MAYBE keep for OOD stress testing

**Recommendation**: Archive to `archive/research_experiments/`

## 🌱 What to Grow

### Week 1: Backtesting Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
1. Install backtesting.py library
2. Create automation/backtesting/backtest_engine.py
3. Implement profit_metrics.py (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Max DD)
4. Add transaction_costs.py (fees + slippage)
5. Test basic walk-forward backtest

### Week 2: OOD Robustness Testing (CRITICAL)
1. Create core_lib/ood/distribution_shift_detector.py
2. Build regime_classifier.py (bull/bear/sideways/crash)
3. Implement ood_test_suite.py (regime-conditional performance)
4. Test performance across different market regimes

### Week 3: Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Integrate fitness_engine.py with backtesting signals
2. Build walk-forward optimizer using Sharpe (not MAE)
3. Create end-to-end OOD_robust_trading_pipeline.py
4. Add position sizing and risk management

### Week 4: Validation & Production (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Run full pipeline on SOLUSDT 3-year data
2. Generate regime-conditional performance report
3. Document and create examples
4. Deploy production-ready system

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After 4 weeks of implementation, you should have:

✅ **Backtesting**: Walk-forward backtest with transaction costs
✅ **Profit Metrics**: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Max Drawdown calculated
✅ **OOD Testing**: Performance tested across bull/bear/sideways/crash
✅ **Regime Robustness**: Consistent performance across market regimes
✅ **Realistic Results**: Includes fees (0.075%-0.1%), slippage, realistic fills
✅ **Automated Pipeline**: One command from data → OOD-validated profit

## 🚀 Quick Decisions Needed

1. **Archive ideas_brewing?**
   - Option A: Archive entire directory ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Option B: Extract market_simulation/, archive rest
   - Option C: Keep all (not recommended)

2. **Backtesting library?**
   - backtesting.py ✅ RECOMMENDED (per CLAUDE.md)
   - vectorbt (more powerful, complex)
   - bt (institutional, harder)

3. **OOD rigor level?**
   - Light: Just regime-conditional
   - Medium: Regime + distribution shift + holdout ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Heavy: Above + stress scenarios + adversarial
