**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Auditor**: ML Feature Experiments Security Team
**Scope**: Time series validation and temporal leakage detection
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL VIOLATIONS FOUND**

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment

| Metric | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Scripts Audited** | 2 (rolling origin, nested CV) | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Temporal Violations Found** | 2 CRITICAL | üö® FAILED |
| **Look-Ahead Bias** | Present in ALL scripts | üö® CRITICAL |
| **Production Readiness** | BLOCKED | ‚ùå Not Ready |

### Critical Findings

üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: ALL temporal validation scripts contain the **SAME FUNDAMENTAL FLAW**:
- **Targets are computed using future data BEFORE train/test splits**
- This creates look-ahead bias that invalidates all cross-validation results
- Models are trained on labels that include information from test periods

---

## Violation Details

### VIOLATION #1: simple_multi_objective_demo.py

**Location**: `feature_engineering/playground/rolling_origin_demo/simple_multi_objective_demo.py`
**Severity**: üö® CRITICAL
**Type**: Look-Ahead Bias

#### The Issue

```python
# Line 183-184 - VIOLATES TEMPORAL INTEGRITY
next_row = sample_df.iloc[idx + config.prediction_horizon]
target_return = (next_row["close"] - row["close"]) / row["close"]
```

**Flow of the violation**:
1. Script iterates through ALL data (line 173-185)
2. For EACH row, computes target using FUTURE data (line 183-184)
3. Creates complete feature matrix with future-looking targets
4. Then splits this matrix for cross-validation (line 521)
5. Model trains on labels that leaked from test set

#### Why This Is Wrong

```
Timeline:  t‚ÇÄ    t‚ÇÅ    t‚ÇÇ    t‚ÇÉ    t‚ÇÑ    t‚ÇÖ
Data:      ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Target:          X <- computed using t‚ÇÇ data

When splitting:
Train:     [t‚ÇÄ, t‚ÇÅ]  (but target X already knows about t‚ÇÇ!)
Test:      [t‚ÇÇ, t‚ÇÉ]  (information already leaked to training)
```

**Correct Approach**:
```python
# AFTER splitting train/test:
def compute_target_for_split(split_data):
    # Only use data within the split
    split_data['target'] = split_data['close'].shift(-1) / split_data['close'] - 1
    return split_data[:-1]  # Remove last row (no future data for it)

# In CV loop:
for train_idx, test_idx in tscv.split(features):
    train_data = data.iloc[train_idx]
    test_data = data.iloc[test_idx]

    # Compute targets separately
    y_train = compute_target_for_split(train_data)
    y_test = compute_target_for_split(test_data)
```

---

### VIOLATION #2: nested_cv_temporal_slicing.py

**Location**: `feature_engineering/playground/nested_hv_blocked_cv/nested_cv_temporal_slicing.py`
**Severity**: üö® CRITICAL
**Type**: Look-Ahead Bias (Identical to Violation #1)

#### The Issue

```python
# Lines 666-673 - SAME VIOLATION
for pos, (_i, row) in enumerate(sample_df.iterrows()):
    # ... feature extraction ...

    if pos < len(sample_df) - 1:
        current_close = row["close"]
        next_close = sample_df.iloc[pos + 1]["close"]  # FUTURE DATA!
        target = (next_close - current_close) / current_close

        feature_records.append(features)
        target_records.append(target)  # STORES FUTURE INFO
```

Then later (lines 1166-1167):
```python
# In CV loop - uses pre-computed future-looking targets
y_train = target_series.iloc[train_idx]
y_test = target_series.iloc[test_idx]
```

#### Detection Claims vs Reality

Script claims (line 12):
> "Temporal integrity validation (no look-ahead bias)"

Script claims (lines 528-531):
```python
# Temporal boundaries with NO look-ahead bias
end_time = period_time  # STOP exactly at bar start to avoid look-ahead bias
if end_time > period_time:
    raise ValueError(f"LOOK-AHEAD BIAS DETECTED!")
```

**Reality**: The validation checks feature extraction timing, but **COMPLETELY MISSES** the target computation bias. The features are extracted correctly, but targets are computed using ALL future data before any splitting.

## Temporal Integrity Principles (User Requirements)

The user specified strict requirements:

### 1. Train on Past, Apply to Future
**User Rule**: "Train on past; apply to future. Never reuse training rows for inference."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Targets computed globally, then reused across splits

### 2. Look-Ahead Allowance (Train-Only)
**User Rule**: "Within each training window, forward-looking labels/features are permitted."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Forward-looking labels computed BEFORE window definition

### 3. Leakage Guard
**User Rule**: "Fit all statistics/transforms/feature selection/hyperparameters **only** on the training window; freeze before inference."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Targets (a statistic) computed on entire dataset

### 4. Boundary Rule
**User Rule**: "No access to any timestamp > train_end when preparing to score the next slice."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Targets for time t use data from time t+1 (beyond train_end)

### 5. Walk-Forward Loop
**User Rule**: "For each window train=[t‚ÇÄ,t‚ÇÅ], test=(t‚ÇÅ,t‚ÇÇ]: fit ‚Üí freeze ‚Üí score ‚Üí roll."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Fit occurs on pre-computed global targets, not window-specific

### 6. Tuning
**User Rule**: "Nested inside the current training window; never uses test data."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Hyperparameter tuning uses targets that include test information

### 7. Prohibition
**User Rule**: "No cross-window peeking; no retroactive refits after seeing test outcomes."
**Violation**: ‚ùå FAILED - Every window "peeks" at next period via pre-computed targets

---

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact

1. **All CV Results Invalid**: Every reported metric (MAE, correlation, hit rate) is artificially inflated
2. **Model Selection Biased**: Hyperparameter tuning selected parameters that exploit the leaked information
3. **Production Risk**: Models will fail catastrophically in real-time deployment (no future data available)
4. **Research Findings Invalid**: Any conclusions drawn from these experiments must be discarded

### Financial Impact (If Used in Trading)

Assuming these models were used for trading:
- **Backtested Performance**: Artificially high (knows the future)
- **Live Performance**: Will be drastically worse (no future knowledge)
- **Expected Loss**: 100% of assumed edge + transaction costs
- **Risk**: Capital loss from overconfident position sizing

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

1. **Misunderstanding of "Rolling Origin"**: Scripts implement rolling windows but miss that target computation is part of the rolling process
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Feature extraction and target creation treated as separate "preprocessing" steps
3. **Sklearn Pattern Misapplication**: sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit only handles index splitting, not semantic temporal integrity
4. **Incomplete Validation**: Temporal checks focused on feature extraction, ignoring target creation

### Common Anti-Pattern

```python
# WRONG (What both scripts do):
1. features = extract_features(all_data)
2. targets = compute_targets(all_data)  # <-- USES FUTURE!
3. for train, test in cv_split(features, targets):
4.     model.fit(features[train], targets[train])

# RIGHT (What should happen):
1. features = extract_features(all_data)  # No targets yet
2. for train_idx, test_idx in cv_split(features):
3.     train_targets = compute_targets(data[train_idx])  # Only train data
4.     test_targets = compute_targets(data[test_idx])     # Only test data
5.     model.fit(features[train_idx], train_targets)
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix Template for Both Scripts

```python
def create_target_within_split(data_split: pd.DataFrame, horizon: int = 1) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Compute targets using ONLY data within the split.

    CRITICAL: This must be called AFTER splitting, not before!
    """
    # Forward-looking return
    targets = data_split['close'].shift(-horizon) / data_split['close'] - 1

    # Remove last `horizon` rows (no future data available)
    targets = targets.iloc[:-horizon]

    return targets

def run_cv_with_proper_temporal_integrity(features_df, full_data, config):
    """Example of correct temporal validation."""

    tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(
        n_splits=config.cv_splits,
        test_size=config.cv_test_size,
        gap=config.cv_gap
    )

    results = []

    for fold, (train_idx, test_idx) in enumerate(tscv.split(features_df)):
        # Split features
        X_train = features_df.iloc[train_idx]
        X_test = features_df.iloc[test_idx]

        # Split raw data for target computation
        train_data = full_data.iloc[train_idx]
        test_data = full_data.iloc[test_idx]

        # Compute targets SEPARATELY for each split
        y_train = create_target_within_split(train_data, config.prediction_horizon)
        y_test = create_target_within_split(test_data, config.prediction_horizon)

        # Align indices (targets are shorter due to horizon)
        X_train = X_train.loc[y_train.index]
        X_test = X_test.loc[y_test.index]

        # NOW we can train without leakage
        model = LGBMRegressor(**config.model_params)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Predict
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)

        # Evaluate
        mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
        results.append({'fold': fold, 'mae': mae})

    return results
```

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)

1. ‚úÖ **STOP using both scripts for any decision-making**
2. ‚úÖ **Notify stakeholders** that all previous results are invalid
3. ‚úÖ **Implement corrected versions** using the fix template above
4. ‚úÖ **Re-run all experiments** with proper temporal integrity
5. ‚úÖ **Document the correction** in all reports and publications

### Short-Term (This Month)

1. **Audit all other scripts** for similar violations
2. **Create temporal integrity test suite** with adversarial examples
3. **Add pre-commit hooks** to detect temporal violations
4. **Training materials** on proper time series validation for team

### Long-Term (This Quarter)

1. **Adopt sktime's proper forecasting API** (handles this correctly)
2. **Use mlforecast or neuralforecast** libraries (built-in temporal safety)
3. **Implement continuous integration** with temporal integrity checks
4. **Peer review requirement** for all time series code

---

## Alternative: Use SOTA Libraries

Instead of custom implementations, use battle-tested libraries:

### Option 1: sktime (Proper Usage)

```python
from sktime.forecasting.model_selection import (
    SlidingWindowSplitter,
    ForecastingGridSearchCV
)
from sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon

# sktime handles temporal integrity automatically
y = pd.Series(data['close'])  # Just the time series
fh = ForecastingHorizon([1, 2, 3])  # Horizons to forecast

cv = SlidingWindowSplitter(
    window_length=100,
    step_length=10,
    fh=fh
)

# sktime will compute targets correctly within each split
for y_train, y_test in cv.split_series(y):
    forecaster.fit(y_train)
    y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)
```

### Option 2: mlforecast

```python
from mlforecast import MLForecast
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# mlforecast handles windowing and target creation correctly
mlf = MLForecast(
    models={'rf': RandomForestRegressor()},
    freq='15T',
    lags=[1, 2, 3],
    target_transforms=[]
)

# Automatic proper temporal validation
cv_results = mlf.cross_validation(
    df=data,
    n_windows=5,
    h=1,  # horizon
    step_size=10
)
```

---

## Testing Protocol

### Adversarial Test for Temporal Leakage

```python
def test_temporal_integrity_adversarial():
    """
    Test if model can predict future deterministically.

    If CV shows high performance on this test, there's leakage.
    """
    # Create data where future is perfectly predictable
    np.random.seed(42)
    t = np.arange(100)

    # Next value is current value + 1 (perfectly predictable)
    data = pd.DataFrame({
        'feature': t,
        'target': t + 1  # Perfect predictor
    })

    # If implementation is correct:
    # - CV will show ~1.0 MAE (can't predict future)

    # If implementation has leakage:
    # - CV will show ~0.0 MAE (model "predicts" future perfectly)

    results = run_cv(data)

    if results['mae'] < 0.1:
        raise ValueError("TEMPORAL LEAKAGE DETECTED! CV should not predict future perfectly!")
```

---

## Conclusion

Both rolling origin validation scripts contain **critical temporal integrity violations** that invalidate all results. The scripts compute targets using future data before train/test splits, creating severe look-ahead bias.

### Summary

- ‚ùå **simple_multi_objective_demo.py**: FAILED temporal integrity
- ‚ùå **nested_cv_temporal_slicing.py**: FAILED temporal integrity
- ‚ùå All results from these scripts: INVALID
- ‚úÖ Fix available: Use template above or SOTA libraries
- ‚úÖ Detection test: Adversarial temporal leakage test

### Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Cease using both scripts for any production decisions
2. Implement corrected versions using proper temporal boundaries
3. Re-validate all previous findings with corrected implementations
4. Consider switching to battle-tested libraries (sktime, mlforecast)
