## Safe Branch Deletion Process

### Current State
```bash
# You are on: feat/orthogonal-alpha-features
# Branch has: 258 modified files vs main
# Status: NOT merged to main
```

### Step 1: Verify Migration Success âœ…
```bash
cd ~/eon/ml-feature-experiments
git log --oneline
# Should show: "Initial commit: Move experimental research from ml-feature-set"

find . -type f | wc -l
# Should show: 199+ files
```

### Step 2: Safe Deletion (Ready to Execute)
```bash
cd ~/eon/ml-feature-set

# Switch to main (abandons feat/orthogonal-alpha-features changes)
git checkout main

# Delete experimental branch locally
git branch -D feat/orthogonal-alpha-features

# Verify clean state
git status
# Should show: On branch main, nothing to commit
```

### Step 3: Start Fresh (Optional)
```bash
# Create new clean branch for production work
git checkout -b feat/production-microstructure-v8

# Only production files, no experiments
```

## What Happens During Deletion

### âœ… Safe to Delete
- **feat/orthogonal-alpha-features** branch (never merged to main)
- All 258 modified files on this branch
- Experimental code now preserved in ml-feature-experiments

### âœ… Preserved
- **main** branch (completely untouched)
- All commits in main origin
- Experimental work in ~/eon/ml-feature-experiments
- Production data files (sample_data, sample_data_v2)

### âœ… No Regression Risk
- Main origin never saw these experimental changes
- Deletion only affects local branch
- All work preserved in new repo

## Cross-Repository References

### If Production Code Needs Experimental Code
```bash
# Option 1: Copy specific files back
cp ~/eon/ml-feature-experiments/feature_engineering/playground/custom_fitness/fitness_engine.py \
   ~/eon/ml-feature-set/ml_feature_set/

# Option 2: Import as separate package
# Add ml-feature-experiments to PYTHONPATH or install as editable package
```

### If Experiments Need Production Data
```bash
# Symlink to avoid duplication
ln -s ~/eon/ml-feature-set/ml_feature_set/sample_data_v2 \
      ~/eon/ml-feature-experiments/data/sample_data_v2
```

## Repository Purposes

### ml-feature-set (Production)
- Production-ready feature sets
- Core package code for AWS CodeArtifact
- Validated, stable implementations
- Follows main origin conventions

### ml-feature-experiments (Research)
- Experimental research and prototypes
- Library evaluations and fail-fast tests
- Playground for new ideas
- No pressure to match main origin structure

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Verify**: Check ml-feature-experiments has all files
2. âœ… **Test**: Ensure no critical files missing
3. ðŸŽ¯ **Delete**: Execute safe deletion steps above
4. ðŸš€ **Continue**: Start fresh branch in ml-feature-set for production work

## Validation Checklist

- [x] ml-feature-experiments repository created
- [x] 199 files moved successfully
- [x] Initial commit created with proper message
- [x] All 8 timeframes complete in sample_data_v2
- [x] Production files remain in ml-feature-set
- [ ] User verifies no critical files missing
- [ ] Execute branch deletion
- [ ] Start fresh production branch

---

**Result**: Clean separation between experimental research and production code, with zero risk to main origin.
