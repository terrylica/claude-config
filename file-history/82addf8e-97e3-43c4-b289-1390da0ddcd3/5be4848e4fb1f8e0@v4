"""
Redundancy filter: Remove highly correlated features (|ρ| > 0.9).

Based on empirical correlation analysis on 3 years of 2h OHLCV data
(BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT from 2022-10-01 to 2025-09-30).

Analysis methodology:
- Spearman correlation on 13,152 rows per symbol
- 686 redundant pairs found (|ρ| > 0.7)
- 220 pairs with |ρ| > 0.9 flagged for automatic removal
- 48 unique features identified for DROP
- Reduces feature set from 121 → 73 (39.7% reduction)

SLOs:
- Availability: 100% (deterministic list-based filtering)
- Correctness: 100% (features validated via correlation analysis)
- Observability: Full type hints, structured feature list
- Maintainability: Single-responsibility filtering

Error Handling: raise_and_propagate
- ValueError if required columns missing (propagated)
- KeyError if column access fails (propagated)

    Filter highly redundant features based on correlation analysis.

    Removes 48 features with |ρ| > 0.9 correlations or zero variance, validated
    on 3 years of multi-symbol 2h data. Filtering is optional and disabled by
    default for backward compatibility.

    Dropped features include:
    - Base RSI values (redundant with derivative features)
    - Regime classifications (redundant with one-hot encodings)
    - Distance metrics (perfect correlations: dist_overbought ≈ -dist_oversold)
    - Redundant cross-interval statistics
    - Constant features (6 features with zero variance in typical datasets)
