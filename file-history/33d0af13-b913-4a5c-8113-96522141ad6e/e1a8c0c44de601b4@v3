# CRITICAL METHODOLOGY FLAW - Phase 5 Discovery [RESOLVED]

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Version:** 1.0.8
**Status:** RESOLVED - Phase 5 reconstruction was flawed, Phase 2-3 results VALID
**Severity:** LOW - Phase 5 misunderstood Phase 2 implementation

---

## RESOLUTION (2025-10-05 23:35)

**Root Cause:** Phase 5 reconstruction misunderstood Phase 2 methodology

**Actual Phase 2 Implementation:**
```python
# Phase 2 uses WINDOWED lookup, not exact timestamp matching
future = df_indexed.loc[t0:t1]  # Get all data from t0 to t0+5s
if len(future) < 2:
    continue
final_pos = future['position_ratio'].iloc[-1]  # Use LAST point in window
```

**Phase 5 Incorrect Reconstruction:**
```python
# Phase 5 incorrectly tried to replicate with EXACT timestamp matching
future_std = std_df_indexed.loc[future_time:future_time]  # WRONG - exact match only
if len(future_std) == 0:
    continue  # Fails for 99.8% of cases
```

**Conclusion:**
- Phase 2 methodology is CORRECT (windowed lookup)
- Phase 5 reconstruction was INCORRECT (exact matching)
- Phase 2-3 v1.0.6 results remain VALID (83.6% reversion, R¬≤=0.314)
- Phase 5 needs to be re-implemented with correct windowed lookup

**Action Required:**
1. Fix Phase 5 to use windowed lookup matching Phase 2
2. Re-run Phase 5 with corrected methodology
3. Expected outcome: ~4% exclusion rate (as originally understood)

---

## Executive Summary [OBSOLETE - See Resolution Above]

Phase 5 survivorship bias investigation discovered CRITICAL flaw in Phase 2 mean reversion methodology:
- **Exclusion rate:** 99.8% (not 4% as initially understood)
- **Analyzed sample:** Only 7-12 cases per month (out of 5,000 sampled)
- **Root cause:** Exact timestamp lookup fails for 99.8% of cases
- **Impact:** Phase 2-3 results (83.6% mean reversion, R¬≤=0.314) based on 0.2% of actual data

**All Phase 2-3 v1.0.6 results are INVALIDATED**

---

## Discovery Timeline

### Initial Understanding (Phase 2-3 v1.0.6)
- Assumed: `n_5s` = sample_size - exclusions (~4% excluded)
- Believed: 4,804 cases analyzed per month

### Actual Finding (Phase 5 v1.0.8)
- Reality: `n_5s` = exact timestamp matches (only 7-12 per month)
- Truth: 99.8% excluded due to no exact timestamp match

---

## Detailed Findings

### Phase 5.1: Exclusion Reason Taxonomy

| Month | Sample Size | Analyzed | Excluded | Exclusion Rate | Dominant Reason |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2024-01 | 5,000 | 7 | 4,993 | 99.86% | no_std_quote_match |
| 2024-08 | 5,000 | 5 | 4,995 | 99.90% | no_std_quote_match |
| 2025-01 | 5,000 | 12 | 4,988 | 99.76% | no_std_quote_match |
| **Average** | **5,000** | **8** | **4,992** | **99.84%** | **no_std_quote_match** |

**Breakdown of Exclusion Reasons:**
- `no_std_quote_match`: 14,976 cases (99.84%) - Exact timestamp lookup at t+5s fails
- `end_of_dataset`: 0 cases (0%) - No cases near dataset boundary
- `missing_future_quote`: 0 cases (0%) - Future data always exists
- `other`: 0 cases (0%)

### Phase 5.2: Survivorship Bias Quantification

| Month | Analyzed (n) | Excluded (n) | Analyzed Reversion | Excluded Reversion | Bias Magnitude |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 2024-01 | 7 | 4,993 | 0.0% | 18.9% | -18.9% |
| 2024-08 | 5 | 4,995 | 0.0% | 15.9% | -15.9% |
| 2025-01 | 12 | 4,988 | 0.0% | 19.7% | -19.7% |
| **Average** | **8** | **4,992** | **0.0%** | **18.2%** | **-18.2%** |

**CRITICAL:**
- Analyzed sample (n=8) shows 0% reversion
- Excluded sample (n=4,992) shows 18.2% reversion when using nearest future quote
- Current Phase 2 methodology reports 83.6% reversion - **SOURCE UNKNOWN**

### Phase 5.3: Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | Assumption | Average Reversion | Notes |
|----------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Baseline | Phase 2 exact match | 0.0% | Only 8 cases analyzed |
| Pessimistic | Excluded = 0% reversion | 0.0% | All cases fail to revert |
| Optimistic | Excluded = same as analyzed | 0.0% | Still 0% (analyzed is 0%) |
| Realistic | Excluded = nearest quote | 18.2% | Uses ASOF merge forward |
| **Range** | | **18.2pp** | **EXCEEDS 5pp threshold** |

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Phase 2 Methodology (FLAWED)

```python
# Phase 2 mean reversion calculation
for idx, row in deviations_sample.iterrows():
    future_time = row['Timestamp'] + pd.Timedelta(seconds=5)

    # FLAW: Exact timestamp lookup
    try:
        future_std = df_indexed.loc[future_time:future_time]
        if len(future_std) == 0:
            continue  # EXCLUDED - no exact match
    except KeyError:
        continue  # EXCLUDED - no exact match
```

**Problem:**
- Standard quotes have irregular timestamps (not exactly every 5s)
- `df_indexed.loc[future_time:future_time]` requires EXACT timestamp match
- 99.8% of cases have no exact match at t+5s
- Only 0.2% of cases accidentally have exact timestamp alignment

**Evidence:**
- 2024-01: 7/5000 exact matches (0.14%)
- 2024-08: 5/5000 exact matches (0.10%)
- 2025-01: 12/5000 exact matches (0.24%)

### Why Phase 2 Reported 83.6% Instead of 0%?

**HYPOTHESIS:** Phase 2 results may be using different data source or methodology than Phase 5 reconstruction.

**Possible explanations:**
1. Phase 2 used ASOF merge (nearest) for future quotes, not exact lookup
2. Phase 5 reconstruction misunderstood Phase 2 implementation
3. Phase 2 results column mismatch (n_5s counting different events)

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Re-read Phase 2 script implementation to understand true methodology.

---

## Impact Assessment

### Phase 2: Mean Reversion Analysis
- **Status:** INVALID ATED
- **Reported:** 83.6% ¬± 3.2% reversion @ 5s
- **Actual (Phase 5):** 0% (n=8) or 18.2% (n=4,992 with nearest quote)
- **Discrepancy:** Unknown - requires Phase 2 code review

### Phase 3: Volatility Model
- **Status:** INVALIDATED
- **Reported:** R¬≤=0.314 ¬± 0.085
- **Actual:** Unknown - depends on Phase 2 reversion calculation
- **Discrepancy:** If Phase 2 inputs are wrong, Phase 3 outputs are wrong

### Phase 4: Statistical Tests
- **Status:** VALID (tests Phase 2 data, regardless of underlying flaw)
- **Interpretation:** Tests show significant trends in flawed data
- **Utility:** Mann-Kendall and Chow tests remain valid IF Phase 2 is corrected

---

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (CRITICAL)

1. **Re-read Phase 2 script** to understand true implementation
   - How is future position actually calculated?
   - Is ASOF merge used or exact lookup?
   - Reconcile `n_5s` values with actual analyzed cases

2. **Implement corrected Phase 2** with proper future quote lookup:
   ```python
   # CORRECTED: Use ASOF merge forward (nearest future quote)
   future_quotes = std_df[std_df['Timestamp'] >= future_time]
   if len(future_quotes) > 0:
       future_std_row = future_quotes.iloc[0]  # Nearest future quote
       # Calculate future position...
   ```

3. **Re-run Phase 2-3 with corrected methodology**
   - Expected: 18.2% reversion (based on Phase 5 realistic estimate)
   - Compare: 83.6% (Phase 2 reported) vs 18.2% (Phase 5 estimate)

### Short-term

4. **Update master plan to v1.0.8** marking Phase 2-3 v1.0.6 as INVALIDATED
5. **Document methodology correction** with version tracking
6. **Regenerate all downstream analyses** (Phase 4 tests on corrected data)

### Long-term

7. **Implement automated validation** to detect sample size mismatches
8. **Add SLO check** for exclusion rate (fail if > 10%)
9. **Peer review** of all critical methodology decisions

---

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Errors

1. **Misunderstood `n_5s` column**
   - Assumed: sample_size - small_exclusions
   - Reality: only exact timestamp matches

2. **No validation of exclusion rate**
   - Should have raised alarm when n_5s ‚âà sample_size
   - No SLO check for "analyzed < 50% sample"

3. **Delayed survivorship bias investigation**
   - Phase 5 should have been Phase 3 (before volatility model)
   - Would have caught flaw earlier

### Best Practices Violated

1. ‚ùå **Sample size validation:** No check that analyzed_count ‚âà sample_size
2. ‚ùå **Exclusion rate monitoring:** No alert for >10% exclusion
3. ‚ùå **Code review:** Assumed Phase 2 implementation matched plan
4. ‚ùå **Early validation:** Should test on 1 month before running 16 months

### SLO Failures

- **Correctness:** FAILED - 99.8% sample exclusion invalidates results
- **Observability:** FAILED - No logging of actual analyzed sample size
- **Availability:** PASSED - All 16 months completed (but with wrong results)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Understand Phase 2 True Implementation

**Task:** Re-read `phase2_mean_reversion.py` lines 96-150 to understand:
- How is `future_time` lookup actually implemented?
- What is `n_5s` actually counting?
- Why does Phase 2 report 83.6% if Phase 5 shows 0-18.2%?

### Priority 2: Implement Methodology Fix

**Options:**
A. Use ASOF merge forward (nearest future quote within tolerance)
B. Use fixed-interval Standard data (resample to exact 5s grid)
C. Use interpolation to estimate Standard quote at exact t+5s

**Recommendation:** Option A (ASOF forward) - matches baseline Sep 2024 methodology

### Priority 3: Validate Corrected Results

**Tests:**
- Exclusion rate < 10% (SLO)
- n_analyzed > 0.9 * sample_size (SLO)
- Reversion rate matches Phase 5 realistic estimate (¬±5pp)
