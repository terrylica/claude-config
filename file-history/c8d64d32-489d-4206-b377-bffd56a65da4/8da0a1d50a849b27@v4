## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-10

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Moved `torch>=2.0.0` from optional[full] to core dependencies (architectural requirement for deep import chains)
- **BREAKING**: Moved `gplearn` from optional[full] to core dependencies
- Made 10 optional dependencies gracefully optional with runtime validation:
  - `skorch` (selection.py) - For Beta-VAE reduction method
  - `sklearn2pmml` (ensemble_learning/utils.py) - For GBDT-LR hybrid models
  - `minepy` (generalization/wcrv.py) - For WCRV (Weighted MIC) fitness objectives
  - `shap>=0.48.0` (function_selection/) - For Shapley-based feature selection (2 files)
  - `xgboost` (strategies/surrogate_model.py) - For XGBoost-based surrogate models
  - `statsmodels` (utility/deletion_utils.py) - For p-value based feature selection
  - `category-encoders` (3 files) - For categorical encoding transformations

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow with Python 3.9-3.13 matrix testing
- Pre-commit hooks configuration (ruff, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-added-large-files)
- Comprehensive workspace documentation (WORKSPACE_ROADMAP.md, QUICK_START.md, DEPENDENCY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Examples reorganization: crypto/ for fork-specific workflows, upstream/ for original examples
- VS Code configuration for zero-setup development
- Runtime validation with clear error messages for optional dependencies

### Fixed
- MSE objective function: Changed maximization to minimization (was inverted)
- RMSE objective function: Added sqrt() transformation, changed to minimization
- MAE objective function: Changed maximization to minimization (was inverted)
- Added missing cachetools dependency to pyproject.toml

### Removed

- Stub RST documentation: AUTHORS.rst, CONTRIBUTING.rst, HISTORY.rst, README.rst (10 files)
- Sphinx infrastructure: docs/conf.py, docs/Makefile, docs/make.bat (3 files)
- Outdated CI/CD: .travis.yml, .readthedocs.yml, .deepsource.toml (3 files)
- Upstream research artifacts: experiment/, data/, tutorial/ directories (29 files)
- 13 __pycache__ directories

## [0.2.4] - 2025-01-XX
