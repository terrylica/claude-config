# Iteration 2: SMA Test - Interim Report (BLOCKED)

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKED at compilation phase

---

## Service Level Objectives - Current Status

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Availability** | 100% | 0% | üî¥ FAIL |
| **Correctness** | 100% | N/A | ‚è∏Ô∏è Cannot test |
| **Observability** | 100% | 50% | üü° Partial |
| **Maintainability** | ‚â• 90% | Unknown | ‚è∏Ô∏è Cannot assess |

**Root Cause**: CLI compilation method from minimal workflow is not working.

---

## What We Attempted

### Phase 0: Create Indicator ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Created `SimpleSMA_Test.mq5` in PythonInterop folder
- Simple algorithm: 5-line SMA calculation
- **Time**: 5 minutes

### Phase 1: Compilation ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Attempted CLI compilation using method from minimal workflow
- **Result**: Silent failure, no .ex5 created, no log entry

---

## Errors Encountered

### Error 1: CLI Compilation with Spaces in Path

**Attempted Command**:
```bash
CX="$HOME/Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/bin/wine"
"$CX" --bottle "MetaTrader 5" \
  --cx-app "C:/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/MetaEditor64.exe" \
  /log /compile:"C:/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/MQL5/Indicators/Custom/PythonInterop/SimpleSMA_Test.mq5"
```

**Result**:
- Command executed, returned empty
- No .ex5 file created
- No new log entry in metaeditor.log
- Last log entry from 2025-10-16 (yesterday)

**Observation**: Silent failure matches Reality Check Matrix Gap #5 (Simple Path Copy)

---

### Error 2: CLI Compilation from Simple Path

**Attempted Command**:
```bash
# Copied to C:/SimpleSMA_Test.mq5 (no spaces)
"$CX" --bottle "MetaTrader 5" \
  --cx-app "C:/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/MetaEditor64.exe" \
  /log /compile:"C:/SimpleSMA_Test.mq5"
```

**Result**:
- `Error` returned from bash
- No .ex5 file created
- Cannot verify log (not checked after this error)

**Observation**: CLI compilation method fundamentally broken

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: CrossOver wine wrapper issue
- `--cx-app` flag may not work as documented
- May require different invocation method

### Hypothesis 2: MetaEditor CLI arguments changed
- `/log` and `/compile` flags may not be correct
- MT5 version mismatch with documented method

### Hypothesis 3: Environment variables missing
- May need additional environment variables beyond CX_BOTTLE
- WINEPREFIX might be required even with --bottle flag

### Hypothesis 4: Terminal not running
- MetaEditor CLI may require terminal64.exe to be running
- Compilation may need active MT5 instance

---

## Impact on Workflow Validation

**Iteration 2 cannot proceed** until compilation works.

**Cascading Failures**:
- ‚ùå Cannot test Phase 2 (Fetch Data) - already have data from Laguerre RSI
- ‚ùå Cannot test Phase 3 (Export MQL5) - no compiled indicator
- ‚ùå Cannot test Phase 4 (Python Implementation) - could do this anyway
- ‚ùå Cannot test Phase 5 (Validation) - no MQL5 baseline values

**Workflow Status**: üî¥ **NOT VALIDATED** - Blocked at Phase 1 of 5

---

## Learnings So Far

### Learning 1: CLI Compilation is Unreliable

**Evidence**:
- Silent failures with paths containing spaces
- Error with simple paths
- No log entries generated

**Implication**: Minimal workflow Phase 4 (Compilation) is not trustworthy

**Recommendation**: Document GUI compilation method as primary, CLI as optional

---

### Learning 2: Reality Check Matrix Was Correct

**Gap #5 Validated**: "Simple Path Copy - Did NOT copy - compiled directly"

**Finding**: We claimed we didn't need the simple path copy for Laguerre RSI, but:
- SMA test with spaces in path: Failed
- SMA test without spaces: Also failed

**Question**: How did Laguerre RSI compilation actually work?

**Action Required**: Re-investigate Laguerre RSI compilation history

---

### Learning 3: Workflow Has Untested Steps

**Assumption**: We assumed CLI compilation worked because "Laguerre RSI compiled"

**Reality**: May have used GUI compilation for Laguerre RSI, forgot to document it

**Impact**: Documentation does not match reality

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stop Iteration 2** ‚úã
   - Cannot proceed until compilation works
   - Fix compilation first, then resume test

2. **Investigate Laguerre RSI Compilation History**
   - Check git history for .ex5 files
   - Review logs from Oct 13-17
   - Determine ACTUAL method used

3. **Test GUI Compilation Method**
   - Open MetaEditor GUI
   - Compile SimpleSMA_Test.mq5 manually (F7)
   - Verify .ex5 created
   - Document this as working method

4. **Update Minimal Workflow**
   - Add GUI compilation as primary method
   - Mark CLI compilation as "Experimental - May not work"
   - Add troubleshooting section

### Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: Fix CLI Compilation
- Research correct CrossOver wine invocation
- Test with minimal example
- Update minimal workflow when working
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Risk**: May not be fixable

#### Option B: Use GUI Compilation
- Document GUI method (F7 in MetaEditor)
- Accept manual step in workflow
- Move forward with testing
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Risk**: Less automated, but reliable

#### Option C: Investigate Build Systems
- Check if MT5 has batch compilation tools
- Look for official CLI documentation
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Risk**: May not exist

## Updated SLO Assessment

| Phase | Workflow Says | Actual Status |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Prerequisites | "5 min" | ‚úÖ Working (verified) |
| Find Indicator | "2 min" | N/A (created new) |
| Analyze | "15-60 min" | ‚úÖ Trivial (SMA simple) |
| Expose Buffers | "10 min" | N/A (new indicator) |
| **Compile** | **"5 min"** | **üî¥ BLOCKED (non-functional)** |
| Fetch Data | "5 min" | ‚è∏Ô∏è Skipped (have data) |
| Export MQL5 | "10 min" | ‚è∏Ô∏è Cannot test |
| Implement Python | "30-120 min" | ‚è∏Ô∏è Could do independently |
| Validate | "10 min" | ‚è∏Ô∏è Cannot test |

**Availability SLO**: üî¥ 0% (Compilation step non-functional)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create this interim report
2. ‚è≥ Choose Option A, B, or C (recommend Option B: GUI method)
3. ‚è≥ Update minimal workflow with working method
4. ‚è≥ Resume Iteration 2 test
5. ‚è≥ Complete Iteration 2 ‚Üí Iteration 3

## Decision Point

**Question**: How should we proceed?

**Option B (Recommended)**: Accept GUI compilation, update workflow, continue testing
- Pro: Unblocks testing, reliable method
- Con: Less automation, requires GUI access

**Option A**: Debug CLI compilation first
- Pro: More automated if it works
- Con: Time sink, may not be fixable

**User Decision Required**: Which option to pursue?

**Status**: Iteration 2 paused, awaiting decision on compilation approach
