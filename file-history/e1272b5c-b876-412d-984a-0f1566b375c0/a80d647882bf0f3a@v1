::: {.scenario-card .positive}
### Shared Responsibility

### Patient Care and Empathy
::: {.context}
A dental office staff member dismisses a patient's concerns about pain during a procedure, saying:
:::
::: {.quote}
"It's normal—just tough it out"
:::
::: {.impact}
Without taking steps to alleviate the discomfort, this approach fails to demonstrate the patient-centered care we prioritize.
:::
:::

::: {.scenario-card .negative}
### Professional Etiquette
::: {.context}
A staff member casually chatting with a colleague in the reception area about their weekend plans while a patient waits to check in, ignoring the patient and delaying the interaction. When the patient finally approaches, the staff member greets them with a monotone, unenthusiastic:
:::
::: {.quote}
"What do you need?"

### Team Communication
::: {.context}

:::
::: {.quote}
"I can't believe how slow they are with setting up rooms; it's so frustrating to work with them"
:::
::: {.impact}
Instead of addressing the issue directly with the person involved or bringing it up through the appropriate management channels, this creates a negative work environment.
:::
:::

::: {.scenario-card .negative}
### Shared Responsibility
::: {.context}
A staff member notices an overflowing trash bin in the treatment room at the end of the day but chooses to leave it for the cleaning staff or another team member to handle, saying:
:::
::: {.quote}
"It's not my job; I've done enough today"
:::
::: {.impact}
Meanwhile, another team member is clearly struggling to finish their closing tasks but receives no offer of assistance. This attitude shows lack of team spirit and unwillingness to support colleagues.
:::
:::

::: {.scenario-card .negative}
### Patient Service
::: {.context}

:::
::: {.quote}
"You'll just have to wait like everyone else. We're doing the best we can"
:::
::: {.impact}
This response lacks empathy and professional courtesy.
