# V2 Strategy Specification — Upgrade Plan

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** 🎯 **COMPREHENSIVE UPGRADE NEEDED**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The v2 spec represents a **major upgrade** from our current backtester. It shifts from:

- ❌ **Momentum strategy** (use T-1 rate, hope it persists to T)
- ✅ **Predictive strategy** (estimate T rate using premium/index formula)

**Key insight:** Our current strategy failed because funding rates have **zero persistence** (correlation = 0.056). The v2 spec solves this by **predicting** rates instead of **extrapolating** them.

---

## 📊 What We Currently Have vs Need

| Component | Current Backtester | V2 Spec | Gap |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-----|
| **Signal** | Use T-1 rate as proxy for T | Predict T rate from premium/index | 🔴 **MAJOR** |
| **Universe** | Top-5 by \|rate\| (no filters) | Liquidity + OI + borrow + tier gates | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |
| **Weights** | Min 5%, max 50%, sum 100% | Same + liquidity caps | 🟢 **MINOR** |
| **Rebalance** | Fixed 8h cadence | Dynamic (1/2/4/8h per symbol) | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |
| **Hurdle** | 3 bps advantage | 3 bps net after all costs | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |
| **Costs** | Trading fees only | Fees + borrow + slippage + error buffer | 🔴 **MAJOR** |
| **Execution** | Instant fill at midpoint | Maker-first, taker near settlement | 🟡 **MEDIUM** |
| **Data** | Historical funding rates only | Premium, index, mark, borrow, L2, OI | 🔴 **MAJOR** |

**Summary:** We have a **bias-free framework** but missing **predictive signal** and **comprehensive costs**.

## 🔍 Key Learnings from Our Audit

### 1. **Momentum Strategy Doesn't Work** ❌

**What we tested:**
- Use T-1 funding rate to select portfolio
- Apply T funding rate as actual return
- Assumption: Rates persist (T ≈ T-1)

**Results:**
- Funding rate persistence: **0.056** (essentially zero)
- APY: **57.33%** (still positive but not exceptional)
- Strategy works despite low persistence because we capture **realized spreads**, not predictions

**Why it works at all:**
- Even with random selection, absolute funding arbitrage captures actual realized rates
- We're not betting on direction, just magnitude
- Low persistence means we can't optimize selection well

### 2. **Predictive Strategy Should Work Better** ✅

**V2 approach:**
- Predict next funding rate using OKX's premium/index formula
- Select based on **estimated** T rate (not historical T-1)
- Apply **actual** T rate as return
- Track **prediction error** and buffer for it

**Why this is better:**
- Premium/index data is **forward-looking** (what market expects)
- OKX uses this to calculate next rate (we replicate their formula)
- Prediction error is measurable and can be buffered
- This is what Victor's `next_funding_rate.py` was doing!

### 3. **Temporal Correctness is Non-Negotiable** 🔒

**What we learned:**
- fundingTime = settlement timestamp (end of period)
- fundingRate = rate for period that just ended
- Cannot trade on settled rates (period is over)
- Must predict NEXT rate, not use CURRENT rate

**V2 spec gets this right:**
- Signal uses **predicted** next rate (forward-looking)
- Costs account for **estimated** next period
- Execution happens **before** settlement (to capture predicted rate)

## 🔧 Required Upgrades to Our Backtester

### Priority 1: **Predictive Signal** 🔴

**Current approach:**
```python
# At time T, select using T-1 rate
rates_prev = snap[snap["funding_time"] == t_prev]["fundingRate"]
target = select_top5(rates_prev)
```

**V2 approach:**
```python
# At time T, predict T+1 rate using premium/index
premium_history = get_premium_history(inst_id, elapsed_minutes)
predicted_rate = estimate_next_funding(premium_history, interest_rate)
signal = predicted_rate - borrow_apr - fees - slippage - error_buffer
target = select_top5_by_signal(signal)
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. Download premium/index historical data from OKX
2. Implement OKX's funding rate formula (changes over time!)
3. Build prediction model using minute-level premium data
4. Calculate historical prediction errors
5. Add error quantile buffer (e.g., 80th percentile)

**Data needed:**
- `GET /api/v5/market/index-candles` (historical)
- `GET /api/v5/market/mark-price-candles` (historical)
- OKX formula change dates (regime table)

### Priority 2: **Comprehensive Cost Model** 🔴

**Current approach:**
```python
# Only trading fees
fee_factor = 1.0 - (maker_fee + taker_fee) * turnover
net_return = gross_return * fee_factor
```

**V2 approach:**
```python
# All costs per symbol
borrow_cost = borrow_apr[symbol] * hours_in_period / 8760
slippage_cost = estimate_slippage(symbol, turnover, orderbook)
prediction_error_buffer = quantile(abs(predicted - actual), 0.80)

net_signal = predicted_rate - borrow_cost - trading_fees - slippage_cost - prediction_error_buffer
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. Download borrow rate history from OKX
2. Build slippage model from historical trades/L2 data
3. Track prediction errors to calculate quantile buffer
4. Apply all costs in signal calculation

**Data needed:**
- OKX public borrow/loan endpoints (hourly polling)
- Historical trades + L2 orderbook depth
- Prediction error tracking database

### Priority 3: **Dynamic Settlement Intervals** 🟡

**Current approach:**
```python
# Fixed 8-hour resampling
snap = df.resample("8H").last()
```

**V2 approach:**
```python
# Per-symbol variable intervals (1/2/4/8h)
settlement_interval = get_settlement_interval(inst_id, timestamp)
snap = df.groupby("symbol").apply(lambda g: resample_dynamic(g, intervals))
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. Query `/api/v5/public/funding-rate` for current interval
2. Track interval changes over time (regime table)
3. Resample each symbol according to its interval
4. Align trading window to settlement times (T-10 to T-3 minutes)

**Data needed:**
- Settlement interval history (from announcements + API polling)
- Regime change table with effective dates

### Priority 4: **Liquidity & Feasibility Filters** 🟡

**Current approach:**
```python
# No filters - select from all symbols with data
rates = all_symbols_with_rates
target = select_top5(rates)
```

**V2 approach:**
```python
# Multi-gate universe filter
eligible = []
for symbol in universe:
    if (open_interest[symbol] < MIN_OI or
        l2_depth[symbol] < MIN_DEPTH or
        borrow_available[symbol] == False or
        borrow_apr[symbol] > MAX_BORROW_APR or
        position_tier_supports_notional[symbol] == False):
        continue
    eligible.append(symbol)

target = select_top5(eligible)
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. Download OI history (public data or vendor)
2. Track L2 depth from orderbook snapshots
3. Monitor borrow availability/caps
4. Check position tier limits for target notional

**Data needed:**
- Open interest (OKX public data or Tardis)
- L2 orderbook (historical market data hub)
- Borrow availability flags
- Position tiers (`GET /api/v5/public/position-tiers`)

### Priority 5: **Realistic Execution Model** 🟡

**Current approach:**
```python
# Instant fill at midpoint
turnover = calculate_turnover(target, current)
equity *= gross_return * fee_factor
```

**V2 approach:**
```python
# Time-aware execution with slippage
if time_to_settlement > MAKER_WINDOW:
    fills = execute_maker_orders(target_delta)
    slippage = 0  # Assume maker fills at favorable prices
else:
    fills = execute_taker_sweep(target_delta)
    slippage = calculate_market_impact(target_delta, orderbook)

# Hedge after actual fills (no naked exposure)
hedge_delta = fills - target
execute_hedge(hedge_delta)

equity *= gross_return * fee_factor - slippage
```

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add execution timing logic (maker window vs taker urgency)
2. Model slippage from historical L2 data
3. Track actual fill ratios (maker vs taker split)
4. Ensure hedge sizing matches realized fills

**Data needed:**
- L2 orderbook for impact modeling
- Historical fill ratios by timing window

## 🎯 Expected Performance Improvements

### Current Backtester (V1 - Momentum)

**Results on recent data:**
- APY: **57.33%**
- Sharpe: **17.49**
- Selection method: Use T-1 rate (persistence assumption)
- Persistence measured: **0.056** (essentially zero)

**Why it works despite zero persistence:**
- Still captures absolute funding spreads
- Market-neutral, so benefits from volatility
- Conservative rebalancing reduces turnover drag

### V2 Backtester (Predictive) — Expected

**Improvements:**
- Better selection using predicted rates (forward-looking vs backward)
- Lower prediction error than persistence assumption
- More comprehensive cost model (realistic expectations)
- Liquidity filters prevent capacity issues

**Expected results:**
- APY: **65-80%** (if predictions have edge)
- Sharpe: **15-20** (may be lower due to more aggressive trading)
- Prediction accuracy: **correlation > 0.3** (better than random)
- MAE: **< 10 bps** (better than current ~15-20 bps spread)

**Key dependencies:**
- Premium/index prediction quality
- Borrow cost stability
- Execution slippage control
- Error buffer calibration

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### 1. **Why Victor Had Two Strategies**

**Strategy #1 (funding_arb_strat_1.py):**
- Simple momentum approach
- Use historical rates as proxy
- Fast to implement
- Had look-ahead bias (acknowledged by Victor)

**Strategy #2 (next_funding_rate.py):**
- Predictive approach using premium/index
- More sophisticated
- Requires more data infrastructure
- Missing backtest (we never found it)

**V2 spec IS Strategy #2's backtest!**

### 2. **Why Our V1 Worked Despite Low Persistence**

**Key insight:** We're not betting on persistence, we're capturing **realized absolute spreads**.

Even with random selection:
- If avg funding = 10 bps per 8h
- With 5 symbols, avg capture = 10 bps
- Annualized: 10 bps × 3 periods/day × 365 = 109.5% gross
- After fees/costs: ~50-60% net APY

**Selection optimization adds ~5-15 pp** if you can predict winners.

### 3. **The Real Edge: Prediction Accuracy**

**Current V1 edge:**
- Selection: Use T-1 rate (correlation 0.056 with T rate)
- Essentially random selection
- Still profitable due to absolute spreads

**V2 potential edge:**
- Selection: Use predicted T+1 rate (correlation ??? with T+1 rate)
- If correlation > 0.3, meaningful edge
- Could add 10-25 pp to APY

**Critical question:** What's the correlation between premium-based predictions and actual settled rates?

## 🎯 Decision Points

### Should We Build V2?

**Arguments FOR:**
- V2 uses forward-looking predictions (better than backward T-1)
- Addresses low persistence issue (0.056 correlation)
- More realistic cost modeling
- This is what Victor intended with Strategy #2
- Potential for 10-25 pp APY improvement

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- V1 already works (57% APY is good!)
- Significant development time (~8 weeks)
- Requires ongoing data infrastructure
- Prediction edge is unproven (need to validate first)

### Recommended Approach: **Phased**

**Phase 1 (2 weeks):** Build prediction model + validate
- Backfill premium/index data
- Implement OKX formula
- Measure prediction accuracy on historical data
- **Decision gate:** If correlation > 0.3, proceed. If < 0.2, stick with V1.

**Phase 2 (4 weeks):** Full V2 backtester
- Only if Phase 1 shows promise
- Build comprehensive cost model
- Implement enhanced backtester
- Compare V1 vs V2 performance

**Phase 3 (2 weeks):** Production deployment
- Paper trading validation
- Live monitoring setup
- Gradual capital allocation

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Decide on V2 pursuit:**
   - Do we want to invest 8 weeks in V2 development?
   - Or deploy V1 now and iterate later?

2. **If V2 yes, start with prediction validation:**
   - Backfill 6 months of premium/index data
   - Build prediction model
   - Measure correlation with actual rates
   - If good (> 0.3), proceed. If bad (< 0.2), reconsider.

3. **If V2 no, deploy V1 with enhancements:**
   - Add borrow cost tracking (easy)
   - Add basic slippage buffer (conservative estimate)
   - Start paper trading to validate
   - Collect live data for future V2

**Recommendation:** Start with prediction validation (2 weeks) to determine if V2 is worth full investment.
