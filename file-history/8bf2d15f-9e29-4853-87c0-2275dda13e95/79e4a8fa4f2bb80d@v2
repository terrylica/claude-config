## üéØ Executive Summary

Victor's funding rate arbitrage strategy demonstrates **strong performance** with a solid framework for portfolio optimization and risk management. However, the backtest implementation contains a **temporal alignment error** (look-ahead bias) that needs correction before production deployment.

### Key Findings

| Metric | Victor's Results | Corrected Results | Impact |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **APY (Recent Data)** | 75.61% | 70.25% | 5.4 pp difference |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 19.45 | 17.11 | 12% reduction |
| **Final Equity (97 days)** | 1.1626 | 1.1524 | 0.9% lower |
| **Strategy Framework** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Validated | ‚Äî |
| **Implementation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporal Error | ‚úÖ Fixed | See below |

## üîç What We Found

### 1. The Temporal Error (Look-Ahead Bias)

**Location:** `funding_arb_strat_1.py` Lines 183-223

**The Issue:**
```python
for i, t in enumerate(times, 1):
    # At time T (e.g., 08:00 UTC)
    g = snap[snap["funding_time"] == t]  # ‚Üê Gets rates at T
    rates = g.set_index("symbol")["fundingRate"]

    # Uses rates at T for BOTH selection AND returns
    target = capped_topk_weights_minmax(rates, ...)  # ‚Üê Select using T
    gross = portfolio_gross_factor(new_w, rates)  # ‚Üê Apply T returns
```

**Why This Is Wrong:**

At 08:00 UTC settlement:
- `fundingRate = 0.000045` represents the rate for **00:00-08:00 period** (already ended)
- Code selects portfolio using this rate
- Code applies this rate as return
- **Problem:** By 08:00, you can't earn that rate anymore ‚Äî it's for the period that just ended

**Timeline of the Error:**
```
00:00-08:00: Period accrues ‚Üí Rate settles at 08:00 = 0.000045
08:00: Victor's code:
  - Gets rate 0.000045 (for ended period)
  - Selects portfolio based on this rate
  - Applies return: equity *= (1 + 0.000045)  ‚Üê WRONG!
08:00-16:00: Next period ‚Üí Unknown rate until 16:00
```

**The rate you'll actually earn is for 08:00-16:00, which won't be known until 16:00.**

---

### 2. The Corrected Implementation

**File:** `funding_arb_strat_corrected.py`

**The Fix:**
```python
for i, t in enumerate(times, 1):
    if i == 1:
        continue  # Skip first period (no T-1 available)

    # Get PREVIOUS rates (T-1) for selection
    t_prev = times[i-2]
    g_prev = snap[snap["funding_time"] == t_prev]
    rates_prev = g_prev.set_index("symbol")["fundingRate"]

    # Get CURRENT rates (T) for returns
    g_curr = snap[snap["funding_time"] == t]
    rates_curr = g_curr.set_index("symbol")["fundingRate"]

    # Select using T-1 (what we knew yesterday)
    target = capped_topk_weights_minmax(rates_prev, ...)

    # Apply returns using T (what actually happened)
    gross = portfolio_gross_factor(new_w, rates_curr)
    equity *= gross  # ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Selection uses T-1 rates** (previous period) - realistic information set
2. **Returns use T rates** (current period) - what actually happened
3. **First period skipped** - no T-1 available at start

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Test Period: June 25 - October 1, 2025 (~97 days)

#### Victor's Original Results (with look-ahead):
```
Period:     2025-06-25 ‚Üí 2025-10-01  (~97.7 days)
Final Equity:   1.1626  (16.26% gain)
APY (CAGR):     75.61%
Sharpe:         19.45
```

#### Corrected Results (no look-ahead):
```
Period:     2025-06-25 ‚Üí 2025-10-01  (~97.3 days)
Final Equity:   1.1524  (15.24% gain)
APY (CAGR):     70.25%
Sharpe:         17.11
```

#### Delta:
- APY difference: **5.36 percentage points** (7.1% relative reduction)
- Sharpe reduction: **2.34 points** (12% lower)
- Equity difference: **0.88%** lower

### Interpretation:

**‚úÖ GOOD NEWS:**
- The temporal error has **minimal impact** on recent data (5.4 pp difference)
- Victor's strategy framework is **validated** ‚Äî the logic works correctly
- Performance remains **excellent** even without look-ahead (70% APY, Sharpe 17)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CAVEAT:**
- This test used **3 months of recent data** (June-October 2025)
- Victor's screenshot claimed **7,708% APY** - suggesting a different dataset
- The 7,708% APY needs to be **re-verified** on the original 1-year dataset
- Look-ahead bias impact **varies by market conditions** and funding rate persistence

---

## üìà Visual Comparison

### Victor's Original Backtest (75.61% APY)
![Victor's Chart](../scripts/okx_funding_arb_portfolio_v8.png)

### Corrected Backtest (70.25% APY)
![Corrected Chart](../analysis/okx_funding_arb_corrected_chart.png)

**Observations:**
- Both curves show similar smooth upward trends
- No dramatic differences in equity growth pattern
- This confirms minimal look-ahead impact on THIS dataset
- Suggests recent funding rates have low T-1 ‚Üí T persistence

---

## üî¨ Funding Rate Persistence Analysis

We tested whether previous funding rates (T-1) predict future rates (T):

### Results (August 2024 sample):
```
Symbol    Observations    Lag-1 Correlation    Abs Correlation
------    ------------    -----------------    ---------------
BTC       27              0.017                0.056
ETH       27              0.089                0.048
SOL       27              0.061                0.064

Average:                  0.056                0.056
```

**Interpretation:**
- Lag-1 autocorrelation: **0.056** (essentially zero)
- **No persistence detected** - funding rates behave like random walk
- This explains why T-1 vs T selection has minimal performance difference

**Implication:**
- Victor's strategy doesn't rely on rate persistence (good!)
- Strategy captures **realized funding spreads** regardless of prediction
- The temporal error matters less when rates are unpredictable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Questions for Victor

### 1. **What dataset produced the 7,708% APY result?**

The screenshot shows:
- APY: 7,708%
- Sharpe: 19.48
- Date: (not shown in screenshot)

Our current test (June-October 2025, 97 days) shows:
- Original: 75.61% APY
- Corrected: 70.25% APY

**Action Required:**
- Identify the original dataset used for 7,708% APY claim
- Re-run both original and corrected backtests on that dataset
- Compare results to quantify bias impact on THAT period

**Possible Scenarios:**
1. **Full 1-year historical data** - May show larger bias impact
2. **Different time period** - Market conditions affect bias severity
3. **Different symbol universe** - More symbols may amplify bias
4. **Configuration differences** - Parameters may have changed

### 2. **Is there live trading data to validate backtest accuracy?**

If Victor has been live trading this strategy:
- Compare live performance vs backtest predictions
- This would reveal real-world bias impact
- Expected: Live results closer to corrected backtest than original

### 3. **What is the intended deployment timeline?**

Recommendations based on urgency:
- **Immediate deployment:** Use corrected backtester, expect ~70% APY
- **Further validation needed:** Re-run on full historical data first
- **Risk assessment:** Live paper trading for 1 month to validate

## ‚úÖ What Victor Got Right

Despite the temporal error, Victor's strategy framework is **excellent**:

### 1. **Portfolio Optimization**
```python
def capped_topk_weights_minmax(rates, k=5, max_w=0.50, min_w=0.05):
```
- Deterministic allocator with min/max caps
- Ensures diversification while concentrating on best opportunities
- Prevents over-exposure to single symbols

### 2. **Rebalancing Gates**
- **Min-hold period:** 24 hours - prevents overtrading
- **Hurdle rate:** 3.0 bps - only rebalance if advantage exceeds threshold
- **Value-vs-cost:** Compares advantage to fee drag before executing
- **No-trade bands:** 5% tolerance - reduces noise trading

### 3. **Fee Modeling**
- VIP-7 fee schedule with maker/taker blend (60/40 split)
- Accounts for both spot and perp fees
- Models turnover impact on performance

### 4. **Data Collection**
- Uses OKX official API (`/api/v5/public/funding-rate-history`)
- Correctly interprets `fundingTime` as settlement timestamp
- Properly handles 8-hour funding cycles

### 5. **Backtest Rigor**
- Comprehensive output logging
- Tracks portfolio composition over time
- Calculates Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted returns
- Generates charts for visual inspection

**These are ALL production-quality components that work correctly.**

## üéì Lessons for Future Backtests

### Temporal Integrity Checklist

When building any backtest, ensure:

1. **Information Set Discipline**
   - At time T, only use data available BEFORE T
   - Selection/decisions use T-1 or earlier
   - Returns/outcomes use T (what actually happened)

2. **Settlement Timing**
   - Understand what timestamps represent
   - Settlement time ‚â† Availability time
   - In funding: rate settles AT T for period ending AT T

3. **Look-Ahead Detection**
   - Ask: "Could I have known this in real-time?"
   - If selecting at T using T's data ‚Üí look-ahead
   - If applying T's return after T's decision ‚Üí correct

4. **Autocorrelation Testing**
   - Measure if T-1 predicts T
   - Low correlation ‚Üí momentum strategies less effective
   - High correlation ‚Üí validate strategy edge

5. **Walk-Forward Validation**
   - Split data into in-sample and out-of-sample
   - Train strategy on historical, test on recent
   - Expect degradation from backtest to live

## üí¨ Discussion Points for Victor

### Strengths of Current Approach

1. **Market-Neutral Strategy**
   - Captures funding payments regardless of direction
   - Not exposed to spot price risk (when hedged properly)
   - Consistent returns in different market regimes

2. **Sophisticated Risk Management**
   - Portfolio diversification (top-5, not top-1)
   - Position limits (5-50% per symbol)
   - Transaction cost awareness

3. **Realistic Assumptions**
   - VIP-7 fees (achievable for institutional traders)
   - 60% maker ratio (reasonable for limit orders)
   - 8-hour rebalancing (matches funding cycle)

### Areas for Discussion

1. **Execution Assumptions**
   - Backtest assumes instant fills at midpoint
   - Reality: slippage, partial fills, market impact
   - Consider: 1-2 bps slippage buffer

2. **Capital Efficiency**
   - Current: 100% capital deployed
   - Reality: Need collateral buffer for margin calls
   - Consider: 80-90% deployment, 10-20% reserve

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - OKX has request rate limits
   - Need efficient batch operations
   - Consider: WebSocket for real-time rates

4. **Symbol Stability**
   - Backtest uses current symbols
   - Historical: Some symbols didn't exist
   - Consider: Survivorship bias check
