# Workflow Evolution Framework - KISS Principle

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Purpose**: Self-improving closed-loop system for MQL5→Python migration
**Philosophy**: Start simple, iterate based on reality, automate only proven patterns

---

## Meta-Level Problem

**What are we ACTUALLY trying to do?**
- Convert MQL5 indicators to Python
- Prove they produce identical results
- Make this repeatable for any indicator

**Current Issue**: We're documenting a workflow we've only done ONCE, with a COMPLEX indicator (Laguerre RSI), and trying to create comprehensive docs before validating the basics.

**KISS Violation**: We're building Level 4 docs for a Level 1 workflow.

---

## The Core Loop (Irreducible Minimum)

```
1. Get MQL5 indicator values (somehow)
   ↓
2. Implement same logic in Python
   ↓
3. Compare outputs
   ↓
4. If match → DONE
   If no match → Debug and goto 2
```

**That's it.** Everything else is scaffolding.

---

## Workflow Evolution Levels

### Level 0: Manual Chaos (Where We Were)
- Copy indicator files around manually
- Compile by opening GUI
- Export data by clicking charts
- Compare in spreadsheet
- **Pain**: Takes 8 hours, error-prone, not repeatable

### Level 1: Documented Manual (Where We Think We Are)
- Written steps for each task
- Known file locations
- Standard comparison method
- **Pain**: Still manual, but at least consistent
- **Status**: ❌ NOT VALIDATED - Only tested once with complex indicator

### Level 2: Semi-Automated (Where We Should Be)
- Scripts for common tasks (compile, export, validate)
- CLI tools for repetitive steps
- Template-based indicator implementation
- **Goal**: 2-hour workflow for new indicator
- **Status**: ⏳ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Need to validate

### Level 3: Fully Automated (Future)
- One command: `./migrate_indicator.sh "RSI"`
- System handles compilation, export, validation
- **Goal**: 15-minute workflow
- **Status**: ❌ NOT STARTED

### Level 4: Self-Validating (Further Future)
- System runs test suite on every change
- Catches regressions automatically
- **Status**: ❌ NOT STARTED

### Level 5: Self-Improving (Aspirational)
- System updates docs based on failures
- Learns new patterns from repeated tasks
- **Status**: 🌙 MOONSHOT

---

## The REAL Question

**Q**: Is our Level 1 workflow even correct?

**A**: We don't know. We've tested it ONCE with Laguerre RSI.

**What we need**: Validate Level 1 with 3 simple indicators, THEN move to Level 2.

---

## KISS Validation Plan (Evolutionary)

### Iteration 0: Audit Reality vs Documentation

**Goal**: Understand what we ACTUALLY did vs what we DOCUMENTED

**Method**: Side-by-side comparison

**Deliverable**: Reality Check Matrix

| Step | What Guide Says | What We Actually Did | Gap? |
|------|----------------|---------------------|------|
| Find indicator | `find ... -name "*.mq5"` | Used this command | ✅ OK |
| Compile | `--cx-app with /inc` | Used --cx-app WITHOUT /inc | ⚠️ GAP |
| Export | Inline OnCalculate code | Used ExportAligned.mq5 | ⚠️ GAP |
| Fetch data | Inline Python -c | Used export_aligned.py file | ⚠️ GAP |
| Validate | validate_indicator.py | Used validate_indicator.py | ✅ OK |

**Action**: Create this matrix for ALL 7 phases

**Time**: 30 minutes

**Output**: REALITY_CHECK_MATRIX.md

---

### Iteration 1: Simplify to Absolute Minimum

**Goal**: Strip workflow down to ONLY proven steps

**Method**:
1. Remove all "nice to have" steps
2. Remove all "alternative approaches"
3. Keep only what we ACTUALLY used for Laguerre RSI
4. Document EXACTLY those steps

**KISS Rules**:
- If we didn't do it, don't document it
- If there are 2 ways, pick 1 and document THAT
- If a step is "optional", remove it
- If we're not sure, test it NOW

**Deliverable**: MQL5_TO_PYTHON_MINIMAL_WORKFLOW.md (3-page maximum)

**Time**: 1 hour

---

### Iteration 2: Test with Simplest Possible Indicator

**Goal**: Validate minimal workflow with indicator simpler than Laguerre RSI

**Candidate Indicators** (ordered by complexity):

1. **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** - 5 lines of code
   - No dependencies
   - No state
   - Pure math
   - **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** - 20 lines of code
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Simple state (gains/losses)
   - Well-understood algorithm
   - **Estimated time**: 45 minutes

3. **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** - 10 lines of code
   - No dependencies
   - State but simple
   - **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

**Test Plan**:
1. Pick SMA (simplest possible)
2. Follow MINIMAL workflow EXACTLY
3. Write down EVERY command executed
4. Note EVERY deviation from guide
5. Time EVERY phase
6. Achieve ≥ 0.999 correlation

**Success Criteria**:
- SMA Python matches MQL5 (correlation ≥ 0.999)
- Completed in ≤ 1 hour
- No "hidden steps" required
- All commands copy-pastable

**Deliverable**: SMA_MIGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md

**Time**: 1 hour

---

### Iteration 3: Update Workflow Based on SMA Test

**Goal**: Incorporate learnings from SMA test into workflow

**Method**:
1. Review deviations noted in SMA test
2. Update MINIMAL workflow with corrections
3. Add "Known Issues" section for unresolved problems
4. Update time estimates based on actual SMA timing

**Deliverable**: MQL5_TO_PYTHON_MINIMAL_WORKFLOW.md v1.1

**Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Iteration 4: Test with Second Simple Indicator

**Goal**: Validate updated workflow with RSI

**Method**: Same as Iteration 2, but with RSI

**Success Criteria**:
- RSI Python matches MQL5 (correlation ≥ 0.999)
- Completed in ≤ 1.5 hours (RSI slightly more complex than SMA)
- No NEW deviations from guide (only known issues from Iteration 3)

**Deliverable**: RSI_MIGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md

**Time**: 1.5 hours

---

### Iteration 5: Convergence Check

**Goal**: Determine if workflow has stabilized

**Method**: Compare SMA and RSI test reports

**Questions**:
1. Did we encounter the SAME issues?
2. Did we use the SAME steps?
3. Did time estimates match?
4. Are there NEW patterns we didn't see in Laguerre RSI?

**Decision Tree**:

```
IF (SMA and RSI tests identical) AND (no new deviations)
  THEN workflow is STABLE → Move to Iteration 6
ELSE
  Update workflow → Test with EMA (Iteration 4.5)
  IF still not stable
    THEN workflow has fundamental problems → Back to Iteration 1
```

**Deliverable**: WORKFLOW_CONVERGENCE_ANALYSIS.md

**Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Iteration 6: Add Automation Layer (Level 2)

**Goal**: Create helper scripts for proven patterns

**Method**: Identify repeated command sequences from 3 tests (Laguerre, SMA, RSI)

**Automation Candidates**:

1. **Prerequisites Check** (repeated every test)
   ```bash
   ./check_prerequisites.sh
   ```

2. **Indicator Compilation** (repeated every test)
   ```bash
   ./compile_indicator.sh "IndicatorName.mq5"
   ```

3. **Data Export** (repeated every test)
   ```bash
   ./export_indicator_data.sh "EURUSD" "M1" "IndicatorName" 5000
   ```

4. **Validation** (repeated every test)
   ```bash
   ./validate_indicator.sh "IndicatorName"
   ```

**KISS Rule**: Only automate if used in ALL 3 tests

**Deliverable**: Helper scripts + AUTOMATED_WORKFLOW.md

**Time**: 2 hours

---

### Iteration 7: Test Automated Workflow with 4th Indicator

**Goal**: Validate Level 2 (semi-automated) workflow

**Indicator**: MACD (medium complexity, uses EMA)

**Method**: Use ONLY helper scripts, no manual steps

**Success Criteria**:
- MACD completes in ≤ 1 hour (faster than manual)
- Correlation ≥ 0.999
- No manual interventions required

**Deliverable**: MACD_AUTOMATED_TEST_REPORT.md

**Time**: 1 hour

---

### Iteration 8: Documentation Freeze

**Goal**: Lock down documentation based on 4 validated indicators

**Method**:
1. Archive old docs (MQL5_TO_PYTHON_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md → archive/)
2. Promote AUTOMATED_WORKFLOW.md to main guide
3. Add validation badges: "Tested with 4 indicators: SMA, RSI, MACD, Laguerre RSI"
4. Create KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md for unresolved issues

**Deliverable**: Production-ready documentation

**Time**: 1 hour

---

### Iteration 9: Peer Validation

**Goal**: External validation with coworker

**Method**:
1. Ask coworker to migrate indicator of THEIR choice
2. No help unless blocked > 15 minutes
3. Collect feedback

**Success Criteria**:
- Coworker succeeds without intervention
- Time ≤ 2 hours
- No documentation bugs found

**Deliverable**: PEER_VALIDATION_REPORT.md

**Time**: 2-3 hours (coworker's time + observation)

---

### Iteration 10: Closed Loop - Continuous Improvement

**Goal**: System for incorporating future learnings

**Method**: Create issue template for workflow failures

**Template**:
```markdown
## Indicator Migration Failure Report

**Indicator**: [Name]
**Date**: [Date]
**Phase Failed**: [Which iteration phase]
**Expected**: [What should have happened]
**Actual**: [What actually happened]
**Root Cause**: [Why it failed]
**Fix Applied**: [How we resolved it]
**Documentation Update**: [What needs to change]
```

**Process**:
1. Every failure creates issue
2. Issue analysis → workflow update
3. Workflow update → test with previous indicators (regression test)
4. If regression tests pass → promote update

**Deliverable**: CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PROCESS.md

**Time**: 30 minutes to create, ongoing to maintain

**This loop runs FOREVER**. Each new indicator teaches us something.

## Emergent Properties (What Happens Naturally)

As we execute iterations:

1. **Common patterns emerge** → We automate them
2. **Edge cases surface** → We document them
3. **Tools stabilize** → We trust them
4. **Time decreases** → Workflow improves
5. **Confidence increases** → We share with team

**The system EVOLVES itself through use.**

---

## Success Metrics (How We Know We're Done)

### Level 1 Complete (Iterations 0-5):
- [ ] 3 simple indicators validated (SMA, RSI, EMA)
- [ ] Workflow documented with actual commands
- [ ] No NEW deviations in 2nd and 3rd tests
- [ ] Time estimates match reality

### Level 2 Complete (Iterations 6-8):
- [ ] 4 total indicators validated (add MACD)
- [ ] Helper scripts created and tested
- [ ] Workflow time < 1 hour per indicator
- [ ] Documentation frozen

### Level 3 Complete (Iterations 9-10):
- [ ] Peer validated
- [ ] Continuous improvement process running
- [ ] Team using workflow successfully
- [ ] Regression test suite operational

---

## Conclusion

**We need to START at Iteration 1, not jump to documentation.**

The system will tell us what it needs through repeated use. Let's build it evolutionary, not revolutionary.

**Next Action**: Execute Iteration 1 (Extract minimal workflow from Laguerre RSI experience)

**Time**: 1 hour

**Output**: 3-page MINIMAL workflow that we KNOW works for at least 1 indicator
