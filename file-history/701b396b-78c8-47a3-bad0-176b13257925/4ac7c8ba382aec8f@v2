## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

This release focuses on internal code organization and maintainability improvements:

### Code Structure Refactoring

- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored processor.py from a monolithic 885-line file into 7 focused modules (53% reduction to 414 lines)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module now has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Maintainability**: All modules follow SLO-based design (Availability, Correctness, Observability, Maintainability)
- **Zero Regressions**: All 48 tests pass, ensuring backward compatibility

### New Modules

- `downloader.py` (89 lines): HTTP download operations
- `tick_loader.py` (67 lines): CSV parsing
- `database_manager.py` (213 lines): Database operations
- `session_detector.py` (121 lines): Holiday and session detection
- `gap_detector.py` (163 lines): Incremental update logic
- `ohlc_generator.py` (210 lines): Phase7 OHLC generation
- `query_engine.py` (283 lines): Query operations

### For Users

**No API changes** - all existing code continues to work as before. This is an internal refactoring that improves code maintainability and sets the foundation for future enhancements.
