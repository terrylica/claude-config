# Milestone: Comprehensive Agent Ecosystem Cleanup and Optimization

**Commit ID**: 7fecac6
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Version**: 3.0.0 (MAJOR)
**Classification**: Breaking Change - Agent Architecture Consolidation

## Summary

Comprehensive removal of 10 specialized agents, consolidating from pattern-matching infrastructure to streamlined research-focused system architecture.

## Changes

### Removed Agents (10)
- `apcf-agent.md` - Application Pattern Compliance Framework validation
- `backtest-strategy-validator.md` - Financial backtesting strategy validation
- `compliance-auditor.md` - Code compliance and audit framework
- `config-conformer.md` - Configuration conformity validation
- `file-structure-organizer.md` - Workspace file organization automation
- `milestone-commit-logger.md` - Automated milestone documentation generation
- `python-qa-agent.md` - Python quality assurance validation
- `sred-evidence-extractor.md` - Security requirements evidence extraction
- `workspace-refactor.md` - Workspace refactoring automation
- `workspace-sync.md` - Multi-workspace synchronization

### Retained Agents (1)
- `research-scout.md` - Multi-perspective research with parallel keyword processing

### Infrastructure Updates
- Updated IDE workspace lock files with current session state
- Cleaned todo state references for removed agents
- Consolidated agent architecture from 11 to 1 active agent

## Impact Assessment

**Breaking Changes**: Yes - Removal of 10 specialized agents breaks existing workflows dependent on pattern-matching infrastructure

**Files Modified**: 12
- **Deletions**: 723 lines (agent definitions, configurations, documentation)
- **Additions**: 23 lines (IDE state updates, todo cleanup)

## Technical Rationale

Transition from complex multi-agent pattern-matching system to focused research-oriented architecture, reducing maintenance overhead while preserving core research capabilities through research-scout agent.

## Validation Criteria

- [x] All agent files successfully removed
- [x] IDE workspace state synchronized
- [x] Todo references cleaned
- [x] Research-scout agent remains functional
- [x] No broken agent references in codebase

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to remote repository
2. Monitor CI/CD pipeline execution
3. Validate agent system functionality post-cleanup
