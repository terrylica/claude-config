summary: Claude Code CLI configuration enhancements with model selection and status line integration

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Balancing new functionality with configuration file simplicity
      impact: Risk of configuration bloat and maintenance overhead
    - description: Ensuring status line integration doesn't interfere with existing terminal workflows
      impact: User experience disruption if not properly implemented
    - description: Model specification standardization without breaking existing sessions
      impact: Session continuity and behavioral consistency requirements

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Initial attempt to use local installation of ccstatusline
      reason_failed: Created dependency management complexity and version conflicts
      lesson: NPX pattern eliminates installation overhead while maintaining functionality
    - approach: Complex status line configuration with multiple parameters
      reason_failed: Over-engineering led to configuration complexity
      lesson: Zero padding configuration achieves optimal terminal layout with minimal complexity
    - approach: Model specification as environment variable
      reason_failed: Less discoverable and harder to version control
      lesson: Direct JSON configuration provides better transparency and maintainability

  successful_solution:
    approach: Additive JSON configuration with explicit model and NPX-based status line
    key_insights:
      - Model specification in configuration ensures consistent LLM behavior across all sessions
      - NPX pattern avoids installation complexity while maintaining latest version access
      - Zero padding optimization provides clean terminal interface presentation
      - Preserving existing hook structures maintains backward compatibility
      - JSON Schema validation ensures configuration integrity

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Additive configuration evolution over disruptive changes
      context: When enhancing CLI tools without breaking existing user workflows
    - pattern: NPX integration for tool dependencies without local installation
      context: When integrating external tools that need to stay current
    - pattern: Explicit model specification for consistent AI behavior
      context: When standardizing LLM interactions across development environments
    - pattern: Zero-padding configuration for terminal interface optimization
      context: When integrating status displays in terminal-based workflows

  future_guidance:
    - Always preserve backward compatibility when evolving configuration schemas
    - Use NPX pattern for external tool integration to avoid dependency management
    - Explicit model specification prevents behavioral drift across sessions
    - Status line integration should complement, not interfere with existing workflows
    - Configuration evolution should be additive and discoverable through version control
    - JSON Schema compliance ensures configuration validation and IDE support

technical_details:
  architecture_changes:
    - Added model specification field for consistent LLM behavior
    - Integrated status line configuration with command-based execution
    - Maintained existing hook structure for stop operations
  new_dependencies:
    - ccstatusline@latest via NPX (no local installation required)
    - JSON Schema validation for configuration integrity
  performance_impacts:
    - Status line provides real-time visibility without workflow interruption
    - NPX execution adds minimal overhead compared to local installation benefits
    - Zero padding reduces terminal space consumption
  security_considerations:
    - Preserved existing access control patterns in permissions structure
    - NPX -y flag ensures non-interactive execution for automation compatibility
    - Hook configurations maintain existing security boundaries

operational_context:
  user_environment: Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux) with POSIX-compliant shells
  tool_integration: Claude Code CLI with enhanced configuration capabilities
  workflow_impact: Improved visibility and consistency without disrupting existing patterns
  version_significance: Minor enhancement (v2.1.0) with additive functionality

configuration_schema:
  model_field:
    purpose: Explicit LLM model specification for consistent behavior
    value: "opusplan"
    rationale: Advanced planning capabilities with predictable response patterns

  status_line_field:
    type: "command"
    command: "npx -y ccstatusline@latest"
    padding: 0
    rationale: Real-time status visibility with minimal terminal footprint

  compatibility_preservation:
    hooks_structure: Maintained existing Stop hook configuration
    permissions_structure: Preserved existing access control patterns
    schema_compliance: JSON Schema Store validation maintained

migration_notes:
  from_previous_version:
    - No breaking changes - purely additive configuration
    - Existing configurations continue to work without modification
    - New features available immediately upon configuration update

  future_considerations:
    - Model field enables future model switching capabilities
    - Status line integration provides foundation for enhanced workflow visibility
    - Configuration pattern supports further additive enhancements

validation_checklist:
  - Configuration file maintains JSON Schema Store compliance
  - Model specification provides consistent LLM behavior
  - Status line integration works without workflow disruption
  - Backward compatibility preserved for existing configurations
  - NPX integration eliminates installation dependency management
  - Zero padding optimizes terminal interface presentation
  - Hook structures maintain existing security patterns
