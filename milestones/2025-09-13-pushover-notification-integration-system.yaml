summary: Complete Pushover notification integration with emergency retry system and API limit validation

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Pushover API documentation lacks critical retry limit details for emergency notifications
      impact: Initial implementation failed with "retry is too small" errors, requiring API testing to discover 30-second minimum
    
    - description: Emergency priority notifications require both retry AND expire parameters simultaneously
      impact: Single-parameter attempts resulted in API rejections, necessitating comprehensive parameter validation
    
    - description: macOS Keychain integration required specific service naming conventions for reliable credential retrieval
      impact: Initial generic naming caused credential lookup failures, requiring standardized service naming patterns
    
    - description: Workspace organization complexity with global tool access requirements
      impact: Direct ~/.local/bin placement conflicted with source code organization principles

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Using retry intervals less than 30 seconds for emergency notifications
      reason_failed: Pushover API enforces HARD 30-second minimum with explicit error message
      lesson: Always test API limits directly rather than trusting incomplete documentation
    
    - approach: Single parameter emergency notifications (retry without expire)
      reason_failed: Pushover emergency priority requires both parameters for proper operation
      lesson: API parameter dependencies must be validated through actual testing
    
    - approach: Generic keychain service names without user-specific conventions
      reason_failed: Credential retrieval became unreliable with ambiguous service identifiers
      lesson: Establish consistent naming conventions for credential storage systems
    
    - approach: Direct tool placement in ~/.local/bin without workspace source organization
      reason_failed: Violated clean separation between executable access and source code management
      lesson: Use symlink architecture to maintain both global access and organized source structure

  successful_solution:
    approach: Comprehensive Pushover toolchain with workspace organization and API validation
    key_insights:
      - Pushover API enforces HARD 30-second minimum retry limit (confirmed via API testing)
      - Emergency notifications require both retry and expire parameters for proper operation
      - macOS Keychain requires consistent service naming: "pushover-user-key", "pushover-app-token"
      - Symlink architecture provides clean separation: workspace source + global executable access
      - API testing reveals actual limits vs documentation assumptions
      - Toy Story sound integration provides consistent Claude Code notification branding
  
  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: API limit validation through direct testing rather than documentation trust
      context: When implementing third-party API integrations with incomplete documentation
    
    - pattern: Symlink-based global tool access with workspace source organization
      context: When building tools that need both global accessibility and organized source management
    
    - pattern: Credential management with consistent naming conventions
      context: When implementing secure credential storage across multiple related tools
    
    - pattern: Parameter dependency validation for API endpoints
      context: When working with APIs that have interdependent parameter requirements

  future_guidance:
    - Always test API limits directly with actual requests when documentation is incomplete
    - Implement comprehensive parameter validation for emergency notification systems
    - Use consistent service naming conventions for keychain credential storage
    - Employ symlink architecture for tools requiring both global access and workspace organization
    - Validate all API parameter dependencies through testing before production deployment
    - Document discovered API limits explicitly for future reference and debugging

technical_details:
  architecture_changes: 
    - Added ~/.claude/tools/notifications/ workspace with organized source structure
    - Implemented symlink architecture from ~/.local/bin to workspace tools
    - Removed legacy setup-pushover-fallback.sh in favor of comprehensive toolchain
  
  new_dependencies:
    - macOS Keychain integration for secure credential storage
    - Pushover API with validated emergency retry system
    - Toy Story sound integration for Claude Code branding
  
  performance_impacts:
    - Emergency notifications validated with 30-second minimum retry intervals
    - Maximum 3-hour duration with 50 retry limit confirmed
    - iPhone 13 mini device integration tested and operational
  
  security_considerations:
    - Credentials stored securely in macOS Keychain with user-specific service naming
    - No credential exposure in command-line arguments or environment variables
    - Secure API token and user key management with proper error handling

validation_criteria:
  - All notification types (normal, custom sound, emergency) tested successfully
  - API retry limits validated through direct testing (30-second minimum confirmed)
  - Credential management working reliably with keychain integration
  - Global tool access functional via symlink architecture
  - Emergency notification retry behavior confirmed on iPhone 13 mini device

implementation_files:
  - tools/notifications/claude-notify: Claude Code-specific notifications with Toy Story sound
  - tools/notifications/pushover-notify: Custom sound notifications with device targeting
  - tools/notifications/pushover-emergency: Emergency notifications with validated retry system
  - tools/notifications/pushover-setup: Credential management and keychain integration
  - tools/notifications/DEMO.md: Usage examples and API reference documentation

api_discoveries:
  - Emergency notifications minimum 30-second retry interval (HARD API LIMIT)
  - Maximum 3-hour duration (10800 seconds) for emergency notifications
  - Maximum 50 retry attempts for emergency notifications
  - Both retry and expire parameters required for emergency priority (level 2)
  - 22+ built-in sounds available plus custom sound upload capability
  - Device targeting works reliably with consistent device naming

workspace_integration:
  - Proper hierarchy maintained with demonstration files
  - Symlink architecture enables global tool access while preserving source organization
  - Consistent with existing workspace patterns and tool management approaches
  - Integration with existing CNS (Conversation Notification System) architecture
