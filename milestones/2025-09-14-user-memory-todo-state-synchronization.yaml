summary: User memory and todo state synchronization with PyPI credential documentation

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Managing PyPI publishing credentials across development environments
      impact: Risk of credential duplication and format inconsistency across systems
    
    - description: Synchronizing todo state changes across multiple concurrent agent sessions
      impact: Workspace conflicts and task state inconsistency between sessions
    
    - description: Documenting credential locations without exposing sensitive data
      impact: Need for structured credential documentation with unique identifiers
    
    - description: Managing IDE session conflicts in shared workspace environments
      impact: Multiple IDE instances creating workspace state conflicts

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Storing PyPI credentials in multiple locations without documentation
      reason_failed: Led to credential duplication and format confusion across systems
      lesson: Credential documentation requires single source of truth with location references
    
    - approach: Allowing todo state divergence across agent sessions
      reason_failed: Created workspace conflicts and lost task state consistency
      lesson: Todo state synchronization must be explicit across agent boundaries
    
    - approach: Generic credential documentation without unique identifiers
      reason_failed: Made it difficult to track which credentials belong to which systems
      lesson: Unique identifiers required for credential tracking and management

  successful_solution:
    approach: Structured user memory with credential documentation and todo state synchronization
    key_insights:
      - PyPI credentials documented with unique token ID (cc934ce2-87dc-4995-812b-1149d7e977cf)
      - Todo state explicitly synchronized across agent sessions through file operations
      - IDE lock files provide session management without workspace conflicts
      - User memory serves as machine-readable credential reference with location documentation
    
    patterns_identified:
      - pattern: Credential documentation with unique identifiers
        context: When managing API tokens and publishing credentials across systems
      
      - pattern: Todo state synchronization across agent sessions
        context: When multiple agents work concurrently in shared workspace
      
      - pattern: IDE session management through lock files
        context: When managing multiple IDE instances in same workspace
      
      - pattern: User memory as structured credential reference
        context: When documenting credential locations for machine-readable access

  future_guidance:
    - Document all credentials with unique identifiers for tracking purposes
    - Implement explicit todo state synchronization when agent sessions overlap
    - Use lock files for IDE session management in shared workspaces
    - Maintain user memory as single source of truth for credential locations
    - Clear completed agent sessions to prevent workspace state pollution
    - Document token formats and authentication patterns for reproducibility

technical_details:
  architecture_changes: Added PyPI credential documentation to user memory with structured format
  new_dependencies: None
  performance_impacts: Minimal - file-based state management operations only
  security_considerations: Credential locations documented without exposing actual tokens
  
  implementation_notes:
    - PyPI credentials stored in $HOME/.pypirc with token-based authentication
    - Todo state files explicitly cleared for completed agent sessions (309ab13c, f93012ba, 7bb0c31b)
    - Active todo state maintained in e9c8bad5 agent session
    - IDE lock file created for session 56831 with Cursor IDE management
    - User memory updated with PyPI publishing command pattern: uv publish --token "pypi-[TOKEN]"
    
  workflow_patterns:
    - Agent sessions complete -> clear todo files to empty array []
    - New sessions create todo state -> maintain session UUID tracking
    - Credential documentation -> user memory with unique identifier reference
    - IDE sessions -> lock file creation for conflict prevention
    - Cross-session state -> explicit synchronization through file operations
