summary: Strategic planning agent addition with comprehensive validation frameworks and todo state synchronization

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Agent specification complexity management with structured output requirements
      impact: Risk of creating rigid, unusable agent specifications that constrain rather than enable
    
    - description: Context extraction methodology without implementation scope creep
      impact: Planning agents must derive comprehensive plans without crossing into implementation territory
    
    - description: Validation framework architecture requiring measurable, objective criteria
      impact: Success gates must be concrete enough to prevent subjective interpretation during execution

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Generic planning agent without structured output requirements
      reason_failed: Produced inconsistent, non-actionable planning outputs that varied by session
      lesson: Agent specifications require explicit output structure templates for consistency
    
    - approach: Combined planning and implementation capabilities in single agent
      reason_failed: Scope creep led to agents that couldn't maintain clear boundaries between planning and execution
      lesson: Separation of concerns is critical - planning agents must be explicitly constrained from implementation

  successful_solution:
    approach: Context-bound-planner with mandatory structured output and explicit implementation constraints
    key_insights:
      - Structured output templates ensure consistent, actionable planning deliverables
      - Explicit "NO implementation" constraints prevent scope creep and maintain agent focus
      - Context binding phase forces comprehensive assumption extraction before planning
      - Validation plan architecture creates measurable success criteria rather than subjective assessments
      - Decision gates provide clear go/no-go criteria for stage advancement

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Agent capability definition through explicit constraints rather than permissions
      context: Define what agents cannot do to clarify their intended scope and prevent overreach
    
    - pattern: Structured output templates for complex cognitive tasks
      context: Planning, analysis, and design agents benefit from mandatory output structure to ensure completeness
    
    - pattern: Context extraction as a formal phase in agent workflows
      context: Complex agents require explicit context binding to derive comprehensive requirements from session history

  future_guidance:
    - Complex cognitive agents require explicit output structure templates to maintain consistency across sessions
    - Agent capability boundaries should be defined through explicit constraints to prevent scope creep
    - Context binding phases are essential for agents operating on session-derived requirements
    - Validation frameworks must include measurable criteria to enable objective success assessment
    - Planning agents should defer all implementation details to maintain clear separation of concerns
