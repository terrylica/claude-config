summary: Zero-tolerance temporal integrity mandate for quantitative finance backtesting

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Temporal integrity violations are the #1 source of backtesting bias in quantitative finance
      impact: Creates false confidence and unrealistic performance expectations that fail in live trading
    
    - description: Future data leakage through scaling operations is subtle and pervasive
      impact: scaler.fit_transform(entire_dataset) uses tomorrow's statistics to scale today's features
    
    - description: Cross-validation with TimeSeriesSplit requires careful temporal boundary management
      impact: Standard sklearn patterns break temporal integrity without Pipeline wrapper
  
  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Manual scaling with global statistics
      reason_failed: Global scaling inherently uses future data to normalize historical observations
      lesson: Any fit() operation on complete dataset violates temporal boundaries
    
    - approach: Standard cross-validation patterns without Pipeline
      reason_failed: Data leakage occurs when scaling happens before cross-validation split
      lesson: Pipeline pattern is mandatory to ensure per-fold temporal integrity
    
    - approach: Fallback mechanisms for temporal violations
      reason_failed: Temporal violations should never be tolerated in financial ML
      lesson: Exception-only failure principle - immediate system failure required
  
  successful_solution:
    approach: Zero-tolerance temporal integrity mandate with ATV framework
    key_insights:
      - Pipeline pattern prevents scaling violations in cross-validation
      - Per-window scaling in walk-forward analysis maintains temporal boundaries
      - ATV 13-point audit systematically detects all temporal violation categories
      - Exception-only enforcement prevents silent temporal integrity failures
    
  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('model', Model())])
      context: Mandatory for any cross-validation in time series financial data
    
    - pattern: ATV (Auditing Temporal Violations) 13-point systematic audit
      context: Comprehensive detection across data collection, feature engineering, training, evaluation phases
    
    - pattern: Exception-only failure for any .fit() on future data
      context: Professional ML in finance requires zero tolerance for temporal violations
  
  future_guidance:
    - Search all .fit_transform() calls for temporal violations before production
    - Validate every ML pipeline demonstrates temporal integrity compliance
    - Use ATV audit checklist regularly to maintain temporal integrity over time
    - Never implement fallback mechanisms for temporal violations - fail fast and explicit
    - Professional quantitative finance demands absolute temporal integrity discipline

technical_details:
  architecture_changes: Added Temporal Integrity Mandate and ATV Framework to defensive programming standards
  new_dependencies: None - uses existing sklearn Pipeline pattern
  performance_impacts: Minimal - proper temporal integrity is foundational requirement
  security_considerations: Prevents false confidence in backtesting that could lead to financial losses

context_documentation:
  violation_categories:
    data_collection:
      - Data leakage (future data contaminating historical)
      - Frequency mismatch violations (mixed timeframes)
    
    feature_engineering:
      - Look-ahead bias (features using future data)
      - Scaling violations (using future statistics)
      - Feature engineering violations (TA indicators with future data)
      - Target generation violations (incorrect temporal relationships)
      - Index alignment violations (timestamp mismatches)
    
    model_training:
      - Memory/state violations (model state bleeding between windows)
      - Sampling/selection violations (cherry-picking periods)
    
    evaluation:
      - Temporal misalignment (wrong chronological order)
      - Time-based splitting errors (improper train/test boundaries)
      - Cross-validation temporal violations (CV fold contamination)
      - Benchmark/comparison violations (benchmark using future data)

  enforcement_mechanisms:
    - Exception-only failure for any .fit() on future data
    - Code audit searches for .fit_transform() temporal violations
    - ATV audit checklist for systematic violation detection
    - Pipeline pattern validation for cross-validation compliance
    - Regular temporal integrity maintenance audits

  professional_standards:
    - Zero tolerance policy for temporal violations in financial ML
    - Immediate system failure required for any temporal boundary breach  
    - No fallback or failover mechanisms permitted for temporal violations
    - Temporal integrity compliance demonstration required for all ML pipelines
