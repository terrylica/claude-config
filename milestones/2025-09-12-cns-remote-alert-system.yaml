summary: CNS Remote Alert System production implementation with integrated audio and contextual TTS

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Audio system integration between remote triggers and local CNS infrastructure
      impact: Remote systems must trigger existing local audio infrastructure rather than replacing it - integration over substitution
    
    - description: Sequential vs simultaneous audio execution for optimal user experience
      impact: Required precise timing control - subprocess.run (blocking) for sequential audio vs subprocess.Popen (non-blocking)
    
    - description: Contextual TTS announcements requiring environment awareness
      impact: Parsing environment.cwd from JSON payloads enables contextual announcements instead of generic fallbacks
    
    - description: Cross-platform git conflict prevention in shared repository scenarios
      impact: File synchronization before committing eliminates merge conflicts when multiple systems modify shared files

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Replacing local audio system instead of integrating with it
      reason_failed: Lost existing Toy Story jingle functionality and contextual TTS capabilities
      lesson: Always integrate with existing working systems rather than replacing them
    
    - approach: Simultaneous audio playback (jingle + TTS together)
      reason_failed: Audio overlap created poor user experience and reduced comprehension
      lesson: Sequential audio execution provides better UX - jingle first, then contextual TTS
    
    - approach: Generic TTS announcements without environment context
      reason_failed: "Notification received" provides no actionable information to user
      lesson: Contextual information (actual directory names) essential for meaningful notifications
    
    - approach: Direct file commits without conflict prevention
      reason_failed: Git merge conflicts when multiple systems modify shared files simultaneously
      lesson: File synchronization before committing prevents cross-platform merge conflicts

  successful_solution:
    approach: Production CNS Remote Alert System with integrated local audio and contextual awareness
    key_insights:
      - Local CNS audio integration preserves Toy Story jingle while adding contextual TTS announcements
      - Sequential audio execution (subprocess.run blocking pattern) ensures proper timing
      - Environment.cwd parsing from JSON payloads enables contextual directory announcements
      - SSH_CLIENT/SSH_CONNECTION environment variables provide reliable remote session detection
      - Git conflict prevention through file synchronization ensures clean cross-platform merges
      - Fire-and-forget background execution patterns maintain <10ms hook performance requirements

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Audio system integration over replacement
      context: When extending existing audio notification systems, integrate with existing infrastructure rather than replacing
    
    - pattern: Sequential audio execution for enhanced UX
      context: Use subprocess.run (blocking) for sequential audio playback when timing control is critical
    
    - pattern: Contextual information extraction from structured payloads
      context: Parse environment.cwd and other contextual data from JSON to provide meaningful user notifications
    
    - pattern: SSH environment detection for routing logic
      context: Use SSH_CLIENT/SSH_CONNECTION variables for reliable remote session detection
    
    - pattern: Conflict-free git synchronization strategy
      context: File synchronization before commits prevents merge conflicts in shared repository scenarios
    
    - pattern: Fire-and-forget performance preservation
      context: Background execution essential for hook systems requiring <10ms response times

  future_guidance:
    - Always integrate with existing audio systems rather than replacing them to preserve user-familiar functionality
    - Use sequential audio execution (subprocess.run blocking) when precise timing control is required
    - Extract contextual information from structured payloads to provide meaningful user notifications
    - Implement SSH environment detection early for reliable remote/local routing decisions
    - Use file synchronization before commits to prevent git conflicts in cross-platform scenarios
    - Preserve fire-and-forget execution patterns for maintaining hook performance requirements
    - Parse environment.cwd and similar context to enable actionable notifications instead of generic alerts
