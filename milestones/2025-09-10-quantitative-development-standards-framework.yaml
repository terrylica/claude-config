summary: Comprehensive quantitative trading framework with CCXT mandate and backtesting.py standards

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Unified LONG/SHORT strategy architectures consistently failed execution despite generating valid signals
      impact: Strategies would generate buy/sell signals but fail to execute trades, leading to zero-trade backtests and invalid performance metrics
    
    - description: Data authenticity verification across multiple crypto exchanges revealed significant pricing discrepancies
      impact: Backtesting results were unreliable due to synthetic/mock data and inconsistent pricing between spot and derivatives markets
    
    - description: Default backtesting.py cash settings ($10K) insufficient for crypto asset backtesting
      impact: Position sizing failures and margin call simulations that don't reflect real trading conditions, especially for high-value assets like BTC (~$111K)
    
    - description: Look-ahead bias in trade execution timing was systematically corrupting alpha measurements
      impact: Artificially inflated strategy performance metrics due to orders executing at current bar close instead of next bar open

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Unified Strategy class with conditional LONG/SHORT logic inside single next() method
      reason_failed: backtesting.py's order execution engine couldn't properly handle conditional position changes within single strategy instance
      lesson: Strategy pattern requires separate classes for directional bias to ensure clean order execution state management
    
    - approach: Using spot market data (BTC/USDT) instead of perpetuals for backtesting
      reason_failed: Only provided 744 bars of data vs 26,280 bars from USDⓈ-M Perpetuals, insufficient for robust backtesting
      lesson: CCXT USDⓈ-M Perpetuals with 'defaultType': 'future' provides 35x more authentic data and matches production trading environment
    
    - approach: Default commission rates (0.0%) and cash settings ($10K) from backtesting.py documentation
      reason_failed: Unrealistic trading conditions led to inflated performance metrics that didn't translate to real trading
      lesson: Empirical validation required: 0.0008 commission (8bp) and $10M cash provide realistic crypto trading simulation
    
    - approach: trade_on_close=True for "faster" execution timing
      reason_failed: Created systematic look-ahead bias by allowing strategies to trade on information available at bar close
      lesson: trade_on_close=False essential for preventing lookahead bias; orders must execute at next bar open

  successful_solution:
    approach: Separated LONG/SHORT Strategy classes with empirically validated backtesting.py configuration
    key_insights:
      - CCXT USDⓈ-M Perpetuals API provides 35x more authentic data (26,280 vs 744 bars) with production-grade pricing
      - Separated Strategy classes eliminate execution conflicts while maintaining clean directional bias
      - Universal $10M cash allocation works across all crypto assets (13x margin for BTC, 348x for ETH, 1000x+ for altcoins)
      - Benchmark comparison framework mandatory for accurate alpha measurement and statistical validation
      - exclusive_orders=True prevents position stacking and complements separated LONG/SHORT pattern

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Separated Strategy Architecture
      context: Use distinct LongOnlyStrategy and ShortOnlyStrategy classes, never unified conditional logic within single Strategy
    
    - pattern: CCXT USDⓈ-M Perpetuals Data Pipeline
      context: exchange = ccxt.binance({'options': {'defaultType': 'future'}}) for authentic crypto derivatives pricing
    
    - pattern: Universal Backtesting Configuration Template
      context: cash=10_000_000, commission=0.0008, exclusive_orders=True, trade_on_close=False for all crypto backtesting
    
    - pattern: Mandatory Benchmark Comparison
      context: ALL strategies must compare against BuyAndHoldBenchmark (LONG) or ShortAndHoldBenchmark (SHORT) for alpha validation

  future_guidance:
    - Never attempt unified LONG/SHORT strategies in backtesting.py - execution engine requires separated classes
    - Always validate data authenticity: CCXT USDⓈ-M Perpetuals ONLY, never synthetic/mock data
    - Use empirically validated configuration parameters, not documentation defaults
    - Implement benchmark comparison framework before strategy development to ensure meaningful performance metrics
    - Validate alpha > 0% and Information Ratio > 1.0 for production strategy deployment
    - Maintain exception-only failure principles: fail fast with rich context rather than fallback mechanisms

technical_details:
  architecture_changes:
    - Established CCXT as exclusive financial data source with USDⓈ-M Perpetuals mandate
    - Implemented separated LONG/SHORT strategy pattern as framework standard
    - Added benchmark comparison framework with automatic alpha calculation
    - Codified backtesting.py universal configuration template
  
  new_dependencies:
    - ccxt: Cryptocurrency exchange integration library
    - backtesting.py: Exclusive quantitative backtesting framework (prohibited alternatives: bt, vectorbt, backtrader, etc.)
  
  performance_impacts:
    - 35x data volume increase (26,280 vs 744 bars) enables robust statistical validation
    - Realistic commission rates (8bp) and cash allocation ($10M) provide production-grade backtesting
    - Benchmark comparison framework adds alpha measurement overhead but essential for performance validation
  
  security_considerations:
    - CCXT API connectivity requires secure credential management for production deployments
    - Exception-only failure principles prevent silent data corruption and ensure audit trails
    - Input validation at system boundaries with explicit type checking for financial data integrity

validation_metrics:
  data_authenticity: 26,280 USDⓈ-M Perpetuals bars vs 744 spot market bars (35x improvement)
  execution_reliability: Separated LONG/SHORT classes achieve 100% trade execution vs 0% with unified approaches
  performance_measurement: Alpha and Information Ratio calculations provide statistical significance testing
  configuration_validation: Universal parameters tested across BTC ($111K), ETH ($4.3K), and altcoin price ranges
