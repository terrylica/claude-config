summary: Extension specification externalization to reduce contextual memory overhead

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Large inline specifications in configuration files created contextual memory bloat
      impact: Essential configuration patterns were obscured by extensive implementation details, making navigation difficult
    
    - description: Mixed abstraction levels in single configuration file reduced cognitive clarity
      impact: Developers had to parse through detailed specifications to find high-level configuration patterns

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Keeping all extension documentation inline within CLAUDE.md for convenience
      reason_failed: Created a 400+ line file where essential patterns were buried in implementation details
      lesson: Separation of concerns applies to documentation architecture - reference patterns work better than inline details
    
    - approach: Using markdown sections for detailed specifications within configuration files
      reason_failed: Made the primary configuration file unwieldy and difficult to navigate quickly
      lesson: Detailed specifications belong in dedicated files, not mixed with high-level configuration

  successful_solution:
    approach: Externalize detailed specifications to dedicated YAML files with reference links from main configuration
    key_insights:
      - YAML provides structured, machine-readable specification format suitable for LLM consumption
      - Reference links maintain quick access while separating concerns
      - Main configuration file becomes scannable reference guide rather than detailed manual
      - Specifications directory creates logical organization for extension documentation

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Configuration file stratification - high-level references with external detailed specifications
      context: Apply when configuration files exceed ~200 lines or mix abstraction levels
    
    - pattern: YAML-based specification externalization for LLM-readable documentation
      context: Use for complex system specifications that need both human and machine readability

  future_guidance:
    - Keep main configuration files under 200 lines by externalizing detailed specifications
    - Use YAML format for externalized specifications to maintain machine readability
    - Create specifications/ directory as standard pattern for extension documentation
    - Reference external specifications via relative links to maintain navigation convenience
    - Apply this pattern proactively rather than reactively when files grow unwieldy

technical_details:
  architecture_changes: Introduced specifications/ directory pattern for extension documentation externalization
  new_dependencies: None - purely organizational refactoring
  performance_impacts: Reduced contextual memory overhead for LLM processing of main configuration
  security_considerations: Maintained same access patterns, no security implications

development_context:
  motivation: Reduce cognitive overhead when scanning CLAUDE.md for essential configuration patterns
  scope: CNS and GFM Link Checker specifications externalized, removed redundant sections
  validation: Verified reference links work correctly and maintain quick access to detailed specifications
  next_steps: Apply this pattern to other complex specifications as they develop
