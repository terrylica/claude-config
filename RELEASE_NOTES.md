- Implement bidirectional sync with official session format - Knowledge Gap: The primary technological uncertainty centered on implementing safe bidirectional synchronization for `Claude Code` session data across heterogeneous development environments. Specific technical challenges included data loss prevention with no established methodology for conflict-free bidirectional `rsync` operations when both local and remote `~/.claude/projects/` directories could contain simultaneous modifications, cross-platform path handling with unknown behavior of `rsync` timestamp preservation across `macOS` and `Linux` environments, format migration risk in transitioning from custom `sage-canonical-sessions.sh` transformation layer (462 lines) to direct official format, and `SSH`/`ZeroTier` integration with no proven methodology for reliable `rsync` operations over mesh networking. - Motivation: The implementation was driven by critical technical requirements including official format adoption migrating from deprecated custom session format to verified official `~/.claude/projects/` standard (documented in commit `2f13857` with Docker-backed empirical evidence), cross-platform development needs for seamless session accessibility across `macOS` local development and `Linux` remote GPU environments via `ZeroTier` networking, legacy code elimination of technical debt from 462-line transformation tool causing tooling failures, and data safety requirements preventing session loss during bidirectional operations. - Hypothesis: Based on analysis of `rsync` capabilities and bidirectional sync challenges, the hypothesis focused on a two-phase sequential approach using `rsync --update` flag to prevent overwrites of newer files during local-to-remote push operations, followed by remote-to-local pull using identical `--update` protection to capture remote changes, with conflict resolution through `rsync --update` timestamp comparison automatically resolving conflicts by preserving most recent modifications, ensuring both environments achieve identical final state without data loss. - Investigation: The systematic investigation methodology implemented environment validation framework with `SSH` connectivity testing using 10-second timeout and `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, disk space validation requiring minimum 1GB available on both systems, command availability verification for `rsync`, `ssh`, and optional `git` backup capabilities. Bidirectional sync implementation included pre-sync metrics counting session files and directories using `find` and `du` commands, push phase using `rsync -avz --update --stats --human-readable` from local to remote with progress logging, pull phase with identical `rsync` command from remote to local with comprehensive error handling, and post-sync validation with statistical comparison of session counts and sizes. Failed approaches eliminated included custom session format transformation via 462-line `sage-canonical-sessions.sh`, symlink-based directory redirection causing path confusion, and single-direction sync approaches leaving environments inconsistent. - Result: The implementation achieved measurable technical outcomes including code reduction eliminating 462 lines of complex session transformation logic, file modifications updating core `sage-sync` executable and `sage-sync-core.sh` library, functional capability providing working bidirectional sync with automatic conflict resolution via `rsync --update`, safety validation with pre and post-sync session counting and size validation, error handling with comprehensive `SSH` timeout and disk space checking preventing silent failures, and format compliance enabling direct synchronization of official `~/.claude/projects/` format without transformation layer. Technical metrics achieved include session directory detection and creation with error handling, cross-platform `rsync` with timestamp preservation using archive flag, statistical reporting of directories and session files synchronized, and bidirectional validation ensuring both environments contain sessions post-sync. - Authenticity: During hands-on implementation, `SSH` connection discovery revealed `ZeroTier` mesh networking required specific `ConnectTimeout` and `StrictHostKeyChecking` parameters for reliable automation, with 10-second timeout empirically determined after connection failures with shorter intervals. `Rsync` flag investigation through trial implementation discovered that `--update` provides critical safety mechanism for bidirectional operations, preventing newer files from being overwritten by older versions during two-phase sync process. Session count validation was implemented using `find` with `-name "*.jsonl"` and `-type f` filters after discovering successful `rsync` operations could complete with zero transfer if directories were empty. Error handling evolution emerged from actual deployment failures where missing directories, unavailable commands, or network connectivity issues caused silent sync failures, leading to comprehensive environment validation function. Docker verification process for official `~/.claude/projects/` format came from hands-on container testing with fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installation and global `claude` installation, proving standard format behavior without local customizations.
