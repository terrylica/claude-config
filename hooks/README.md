# Automation Hooks

Event-driven automation and integrations for Claude Code.

## Hook System

Automated responses to Claude Code events and interactions:

- **Followup Logging**: `followup.log` - Tracks automated follow-up actions
- **Event Processing**: Integration with external systems and workflows
- **Debug Wrappers**: Located in `automation/scripts/hook_debug_wrapper.sh`

## Configuration

Hooks are configured through `settings.json` and executed automatically based on Claude Code events and triggers.
