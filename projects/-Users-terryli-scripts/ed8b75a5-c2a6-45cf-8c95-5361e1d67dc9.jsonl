It offers sophisticated features for test-driven development and automated code generation.\n\n2. **Aider** - Aider (GitHub stars: 35.2k) — Standout feature: Seamless Git-integrated inline editing Aider is one of the most complete agentic CLI tools, supporting conversational prompting, multi-turn refinement, multi-file awaren\n\n3. **Rovo Dev CLI** - Rovo Dev Agent is now available in the CLI, turning your command line into an intelligent development agent that understands, codes, and collaborates with you. Rovo Dev CLI achieves the highest score on the SWE-bench full benchmark leaderboard, reaching 41.98% resolve rate across 2,294 tasks in the full dataset, surpassing all other submissions.\n\n4. **Qodo Command** - With Qodo Command, you can turn any IDE into an agentic environment, without needing a plugin or integration. Whether you're in VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, or something else, the CLI gives you access to the same agentic workflows: code generation, test creation, error triage, and more.\n\n### Key Features and Capabilities\n\nThese integrate models like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini into your development workflow, allowing you to generate, edit, and refactor code without leaving the command line.(no content)Most support models come from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google.\n\n### Market Shift Toward Terminal-Based AI\n\nBut as agentic AI grows more powerful and vibe coding takes off, a subtle shift has changed how AI systems are interacting with software. Instead of working on code, they're increasingly interacting directly with the shell of whatever system they're installed in. It's a significant change in how AI-powered software development happens — and despite the low profile, it could have significant implications for where the field goes from here.(no content)\"Our big bet is that there's a future in which 95% of LLM-computer interaction is through a terminal-like interface,\" says Mike Merrill, co-creator of the leading terminal-focused benchmark Terminal-Bench.\n\n### Benefits of CLI-Based Agentic Tools\n\nCLI-based coding platforms use a minimal interface to communicate with AI models. Since these tools have minimal UI, you get things done faster.(no content)Although developers can use both categories to work on large projects, command-line coding tools provide raw and low-level access to LLMs. They do not offer a graphical UI, so there's a steeper learning curve and more control.\n\nThe search results show that 2025 has been a significant year for agentic CLI tool releases, with major AI companies launching sophisticated command-line interfaces that integrate directly with large language models for coding assistance."}]},"uuid":"1dd35e1e-3c1d-44bb-a7de-54cfc1b181bd","timestamp":"2025-07-24T06:52:33.962Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"agentic CLI tools 2025 artificial intelligence command line agent tools released","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Ag45xERdiJrqKb8iHACsLb","content":[{"title":"Agentic CLI: Top 10+ Open Source Tools in 2025","url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/agentic-cli/"},{"title":"Compare the Top 5 Agentic CLI Coding Tools","url":"https://getstream.io/blog/agentic-cli-tools/"},{"title":"The 20 Hottest Agentic AI Tools And Agents Of 2025 (So Far) - MarkTechPost","url":"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/07/17/the-20-hottest-agentic-ai-tools-and-agents-of-2025-so-far/"},{"title":"Rovo Dev agent, now available in the CLI - Work Life by Atlassian","url":"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/rovo-dev-command-line-interface"},{"title":"5 Must-Have Command Line AI Tools | by Piotr | Medium","url":"https://piotrzan.medium.com/5-must-have-command-line-ai-tools-839b0cf95c97"},{"title":"AI coding tools are shifting to a surprising place: The terminal | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/ai-coding-tools-are-shifting-to-a-surprising-place-the-terminal/"},{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"Introducing Qodo Command: Build, Run, and Automate Agents Anywhere in your SDLC","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/introducing-qodo-gen-cli-build-run-and-automate-agents-anywhere-in-your-sdlc/"},{"title":"Compare the 3 Best Agentic CLI Coding Tools | by Amos Gyamfi | Jun, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@amosgyamfi/compare-the-3-best-agentic-cli-coding-tools-73d215c5fbca"},{"title":"A lightning fast, new agentic coding experience within the Amazon Q Developer CLI | AWS DevOps & Developer Productivity Blog","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-the-enhanced-command-line-interface-in-amazon-q-developer/"}]},"I found comprehensive information about agentic CLI tools released in 2025.

The default is o4-mini, but pass --model gpt-4.1 or set model: gpt-4.1 in your config file to override.\n\n## Platform Support\n\nCodex officially supports macOS and Linux. Windows support is experimental and may require WSL.\n\n## Relationship to Broader Codex Initiative\n\nThe CLI tool is part of a larger Codex ecosystem. Last month, we launched Codex CLI, a lightweight open-source coding agent that runs in your terminal. It brings the power of models like o3 and o4-mini into your local workflow, making it easy to pair with them to complete tasks faster.\n\nAdditionally, there's a cloud-based version: Today we're launching a research preview of Codex: a cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on many tasks in parallel. Codex can perform tasks for you such as writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests for review; each task runs in its own cloud sandbox environment, preloaded with your repository.\n\n## Funding Initiative\n\nWe're excited to launch a $1 million initiative supporting open source projects that use Codex CLI and other OpenAI models. Grants are awarded up to $25,000 API credits.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nIn 2021, OpenAI released Codex, an AI system designed to generate code from natural language prompts.

Qodo Command is a command-line interface for running and managing AI agents that allows you to automate complex workflows, interact with AI models and external tools using your own tools and schemas, and serve AI agents as HTTP services — all from your terminal.\n\n## Key Features and Agentic Coding Capabilities\n\n### Agent Framework\nQodo Gen CLI provides a simple yet powerful framework where developers can define custom agents through straightforward configuration files. Developers specify what triggers their agent, what tools it can access, what instructions guide its behavior, and what output it should produce. The framework handles all the complexity of AI orchestration, tool integration, and execution of multi-step tasks.\n\n### Pre-built Agents\nQodo comes with several ready-made agents for common needs, including a code review bot that suggests improvements, a test generation agent to increase coverage, and a release notes generator to draft change logs. These agents integrate seamlessly with existing development tools through GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and other CI/CD systems.\n\n### GitHub Integration and Workflows\nThe test coverage agent analyzes the code changes in a pull request, identifies lines that are not covered by tests, and generates a test suite specifically targeting those gaps. It uses the diff to determine which files and functions were modified, then creates relevant test cases. When triggered, it generates tests, commits them to a new branch, and opens a follow-up pull request that adds the tests to the original PR branch.\n\nUsing a simple GitHub workflow automation, the release notes agent can be triggered to review all changes and generate a clear, structured summary of what shipped, including key updates, fixes, and technical details. The agent then opens a pull request to update your RELEASE_NOTES.md file automatically.\n\n## Deployment Modes and Integration\n\n### Multiple Execution Modes\nQodo Command is built to integrate seamlessly into any environment by supporting multiple execution modes, each tailored for different stages of the development lifecycle. In CI mode, agents run with simplified, machine-readable output — perfect for build pipelines and automated validation tasks. This ensures clean logs, clear pass/fail signals, and easy integration with tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.\n\n### Webhook and MCP Support\nWebhook mode turns agents into HTTP endpoints, allowing external systems to trigger them with POST requests. You can wire up agents to events from issue trackers, chatbots, or internal tools and respond in real time. With MCP mode, agents function as callable services. This allows you to plug them into orchestrators like LangChain or use them as internal tools in your AI stack, all without exposing sensitive API keys.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n### Model Support\nUnder the hood, Qodo Gen CLI is model-agnostic. It currently supports OpenAI's GPT (e.g., GPT-3.5/4) and Anthropic's Claude models for its agents' brains. Key capabilities include support for leading coding LLMs (including OpenAI o3, and Claude Sonnet 4), a web-based UI, on-premise deployment options for enterprises with strict security requirements, and a growing library of reference implementations.\n\n### Installation and Access\nYou can install Qodo's CLI via NPM: npm install -g @qodo/gen. After that, running Qodo in your terminal will let you initialize or launch agents. (It's language-agnostic since it's a Node.js CLI, works wherever Node runs.). Qodo Gen CLI is available as a free tool (in Alpha), with enterprise support plans if needed.\n\n## IDE Integration\nWith Qodo Command, you can turn any IDE into an agentic environment, without needing a plugin or integration. Whether you're in VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, or something else, the CLI gives you access to the same agentic workflows: code generation, test creation, error triage, and more. This makes it easy to bring AI-powered assistance into any part of your development stack, without changing how or where you work.\n\nThe tool represents a significant advancement in agentic coding, allowing developers to create custom AI agents for their specific workflows while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with existing development tools and processes."}]},"uuid":"839b60eb-27e4-48cb-b2b8-63ed7b557f06","timestamp":"2025-07-24T06:53:28.832Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Qodo Command CLI tool 2025 release GitHub features agentic coding","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018BMVSMB4yiaDWBHAAVNZ81","content":[{"title":"Introducing Qodo Command: Build, Run, and Automate Agents Anywhere in your SDLC","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/introducing-qodo-gen-cli-build-run-and-automate-agents-anywhere-in-your-sdlc/"},{"title":"AI Coding Assistants for Terminal: Claude Code, Gemini CLI & Qodo Compared","url":"https://www.prompt.security/blog/ai-coding-assistants-make-a-cli-comeback"},{"title":"Qodo Launches CLI Agent Framework, Enabling Any Developer to Create Specialized Coding Agents in Minutes","url":"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qodo-launches-cli-agent-framework-enabling-any-developer-to-create-specialized-coding-agents-in-minutes-302490801.html"},{"title":"Qodo (formerly Codium) | AI Agents for Code, Review & Workflows","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/"},{"title":"Qodo Gen 1.0: Enterprise-Grade Agentic AI Coding","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/introducing-qodo-gen-1-0-agentic-flows-for-the-enterprise/"},{"title":"Qodo launches CLI agent framework - SD Times","url":"https://sdtimes.com/ai/qodo-launches-cli-agent-framework/"},{"title":"GitHub - qodo-ai/command: The Qodo Gen CLI lets you interact with the Qodo platform from your terminal for automation, advanced AI workflows, or CI/CD integration.","url":"https://github.com/qodo-ai/command"},{"title":"QodoAI: Code with an agentic AI","url":"https://codeparrot.ai/blogs/qodoai-code-with-an-agentic-ai"},{"title":"Agentic Coding Principles & Practices | agentic-coding","url":"https://agentic-coding.github.io/"},{"title":"Qodo Launches CLI Agent Framework, Enabling Any Developer to Create Specialized Coding Agents in Minutes | Morningstar","url":"https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20250625ln17240/qodo-launches-cli-agent-framework-enabling-any-developer-to-create-specialized-coding-agents-in-minutes"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Qodo Command CLI tool and its 2025 release with agentic coding features:\n\n## Qodo Command CLI Tool 2025 Release\n\nQodo announced the release of Qodo Gen CLI (also known as Qodo Command) on June 25, 2025, as a powerful command-line interface for building, managing and running AI agents.
