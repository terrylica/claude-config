Validation and corrections\n4. **Documentation** (`docs:`) - Knowledge capture\n5. **Release Management** (`release:`) - Deployment readiness\n6. **Maintenance** (`style:`, `chore:`) - Process improvements\n7. **Work in Progress** (`wip:`) - Development snapshots (avoid in production)\n\n**Atomic Grouping Rules**:\n- **Related files together** - Files that implement the same feature\n- **Dependency respect** - Infrastructure before features that depend on it\n- **Audit trail clarity** - Each commit tells complete SR&ED story\n- **Rollback safety** - Each commit is independently functional\n\n### Auto-Derivation Intelligence (Workspace State → SR&ED Evidence)\n\n#### File Pattern → Domain Detection\n\n- `*.py, *.ipynb` → Algorithm/ML Development  \n- `*.js, *.ts, *.jsx` → Frontend/API Innovation\n- `*.sql, *.db` → Database Architecture Research\n- `*.yaml, *.json, *.toml` → Configuration Investigation\n- `test_*, *.test.*` → Validation Methodology\n- `Dockerfile, *.sh` → Infrastructure Innovation\n- `*.md, docs/` → Knowledge Capture Investigation\n\n#### Workspace Analysis → SR&ED Scope & Priority\n\n- **Single file change** → Focused technical uncertainty\n- **Multiple related files** → Comprehensive investigation  \n- **Cross-domain changes** → System-wide innovation\n- **New file additions** → Experimental development\n- **Dependency changes** → Technology integration research\n\n#### APCF Evidence Standards - Direct Quantitative Measures + CRA Compliance\n\n- **Specificity over Generality**: Use actual counts, technology names, file types, and commit scope instead of vague descriptors (\"modified 3 files\" not \"comprehensive changes\")\n- **Facts over Interpretation**: State direct technical actions and avoid derived metrics (\"what was built\" not \"how well it performs\")  \n- **CRA Audit Defense**: Include failure documentation, vary language patterns for anti-AI detection, and document work-commit time correlation for contemporaneous compliance\n\n#### APCF Evidence Standards - Direct Quantitative Measures Only\n\n- Use actual file counts: \"modified 3 files\" not \"comprehensive changes\"\n- Use actual line counts: \"added 127 lines\" not \"extensive implementation\"  \n- Use actual technology names: \"implemented GitPython integration\" not \"advanced technology adoption\"\n- Use actual file types: \"restructured .py analyzer modules\" not \"architectural innovation\"\n- Use actual commit scope: \"single-repository analysis\" not \"system-wide advancement\"\n- Avoid derived metrics: no \"efficiency ratios\", \"performance improvements\", or calculated benefits\n- State direct technical actions: what was built, not how well it performs\n\n### Search & Audit Trail Integration\n\n**Hash-Based Evidence Linking**:\n\n- Every commit becomes searchable audit evidence\n- Cross-repository SR&ED pattern recognition\n- Automatic evidence chain building for quarterly reports\n- Government audit trail with direct commit verification\n\n**Mitigation Required**: \n\n- Include authentic developer notes, failure documentation, and work-commit timestamps\n- Use actual technology names: \"implemented GitPython integration\" not \"advanced technology adoption\"\n- Use actual file types: \"restructured .py analyzer modules\" not \"architectural innovation\"\n- Use actual commit scope: \"single-repository analysis\" not \"system-wide advancement\"\n- Avoid derived metrics: no \"efficiency ratios\", \"performance improvements\", or calculated benefits\n- State direct technical actions: what was built, not how well it performs\n\n### Search & Audit Trail Integration\n\n**Hash-Based Evidence Linking**:\n\n- Every commit becomes searchable audit evidence\n- Cross-repository SR&ED pattern recognition\n- Automatic evidence chain building for quarterly reports\n- Government audit trail with direct commit verification\n\n## 🧠 Workspace\n\n- `uv run python -c \"import pathlib;g=next((x for x in [pathlib.Path.cwd()]+list(pathlib.Path.cwd().parents) if (x/'.git').exists()),pathlib.Path.cwd());print(g)\"`\n\n- **Tools**: uv, black, ruff, mypy, pytest  \n- **Python**: 3.11+, type hints required  \n- **Commands**: Use `make` or `uv run` for operations\n\n### Root README.md Link Farm Policy\n\n- In the root workspace, README.md must only aggregate links to documentation files or directories. Delegate all content details to target files/directories. When linking to a directory, default is valid—GitHub will auto-render directory's README.md if present. Avoid embedding substantive docs directly; centralize navigation, decentralize details.\n\n## Cache System\n\n- Uses `platformdirs` for platform-appropriate cache directories (not workspace dirs)\n\n## Development Environment Preferences\n\n### Python Package Management\n- **Primary Tool**: `uv` for all Python operations\n- **Avoid**: pip, conda, pipenv\n\n### System Environment\n- **Platform**: macOS\n- **Shell**: zsh\n- **Working Directory**: `/Users/terryli/scripts`\n\n## Claude Code Extensions\n\n### Intelligent Text-to-Speech Hook System\n**Purpose**: Audio feedback for Claude Code responses\n\n#### Core Files\n- **Main Script**: `/Users/terryli/.claude/claude_response_speaker.sh`\n- **Entry Point**: `/Users/terryli/.claude/tts_hook_entry.sh`\n- **Configuration**: `/Users/terryli/.claude/settings.json`\n- **Debug Logs**: `/tmp/claude_tts_debug.log`","numLines":176,"startLine":1,"totalLines":176}}}
