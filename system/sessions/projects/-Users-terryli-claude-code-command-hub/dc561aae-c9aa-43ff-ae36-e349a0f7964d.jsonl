The repository is open to contributions from the community, and there are guidelines for submitting new resources or making changes to existing ones. (See `CLAUDE.md` for additional context.)

Adding a resource consists in simply adding a new entry to the list of resources in the `README.md` file, in the appropriate place, and with the correct formatting. You are a helpful assistant who can provide guidance on anything from formatting a submission, creating a pull request on GitHub, or crafting an effective description.

E.g., a file named `hello-world.md` will expost a slash-command invoked with `/hello-world`. (CAVEAT: If the slash-command `.md` file is nested within a sub-directory of `./claude`, then the invocation command within Claude Code may also include prefixes corresponding to the parent directories of the file (e.g. `/project:devops:trvial:hello-world` for `.claude/devops/trivial/hello-world.md`.)

They may also be a higher-level description of a particular Claude Code integration or usage pattern. For example, a `.claude/commands/` directory which contains a set of commands that a project uses to write test suites, should be categorized as a `Workflow`, instead of merely a series of individual slash-commands. The entry title should be a short descriptive name for the workflow (e.g. \"Documentation Maintainer\" or \"Project Management Workflow\"). Help the user come up with an appropriate name if they wish, and review the name that they submit if they do so.\n    28‚Üí\n    29‚Üí### Additional Resources\n    30‚Üí\n    31‚ÜíAdditional Resources are for other applications or tools that are layered on top of Claude Code, or somehow enhance Claude Code, but do not consist merely in Claude Code \"native documents\" like `CLAUDE.md` files, slash-commands, and the other parts of the official Anthropic Claude Control \"control flow.\"\n    32‚Üí\n    33‚Üí### Official Documentation\n    34‚Üí\n    35‚ÜíOfficial documentation is any documentation that is provided by Anthropic, and is not a third-party resource. Generally, this would consist in links to pages on `docs.anthropic.com`, or to an Anthropic GitHub repository. You may not be able to access resources on this website yourself. These types of submissions are likely to be less frequent - small changes in documentation pages should not be submitted - instead, suggest to the user that they open an Issue in the repository to discuss the change. On the other hand, if, for example, Anthropic adds an entirely new section or resource to their documentation site, this may be worth submitting as a resource.\n    36‚Üí\n    37‚Üí### Repository-Related PRs\n    38‚Üí\n    39‚ÜíA user may find a defect in the repository itself, and may wish to submit a PR to fix it. That's perfectly acceptable, however your role in these cases would most likely be rather minimal. Do NOT attempt to judge or evaluate the PR, however you may provide general assistance to the user about how to create a fork of a repository, how to perform git operations, how to submit a Pull Reqest, etc, and you may be asked to perform these actions, if the relevant tools are available to you.\n    40‚Üí\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

It supports custom user-provided encoder and decoder modules for the transformer.\n\n**Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**: The internal sub models are adopted from pytorch-forecasting's TemporalFusionTransformer implementation, supporting past covariates, future covariates, static covariates, as well as probabilistic forecasting.\n\n## Custom Features Integration\n\nCategorical features are passed through embedding layers to represent them in a dense form then fed to the transformer block. The Time Series Transformer requires additional time features as \"positional encodings\" and only learns additional embeddings for static_categorical_features.\n\nCustom features can include:\n- Future covariates like 'onpromotion' and 'dcoilwtico' (daily oil price), and categorical variables like 'holiday' columns\n- Static covariates that remain unchanged over time including identifiers and categorical variables\n\n## Production Considerations\n\nForecast generation can be parallelized by Ray for faster runtime, either on a laptop or on any cloud.

This architecture is particularly valuable for time series applications where immediate insights are critical, such as fraud detection or dynamic pricing.\n\n## Streaming Feature Engineering\n\nFlink processes raw data streams, performing real-time feature extraction and enrichment, using techniques like point-in-time lookups to prevent training-inference skew, ensuring the same features are used in both phases. Typical application scenarios include data cleaning, feature engineering and extraction, transformations, multi-stream merging and joins, aggregations, and more.\n\n## Online Machine Learning with River\n\nThe search results highlight River as an online machine learning library particularly suited for streaming scenarios. River's README highlights when to use online ML: \"You want a model that can learn from new data without having to revisit past data.

This is particularly valuable for large model inference where the predication latency is high (eg. 5sec) for a large model inference.(no content)This feature will send the intermediate prediction results to user once the results are ready. This feature is to improve user prediction experience.\n\n## Time Series Transformer Inference\n\nFor time series transformers specifically, the below function is the code you need to run inference with a time series Transformer model in PyTorch. The inference process involves an iterative approach where the inference functions relies on a loop to iteratively produce the tgt, the function can be slow if m is big because this will increase the number of iterations in the loop. This is the main drawback of the approach described above.(no content)At inference time, we give the final value of the past_values as input to the decoder. Next, we can sample from the model to make a prediction at the next time step, which is then fed to the decoder in order to make the next prediction (also called autoregressive generation).\n\n## Production Deployment Features\n\nTorchServe offers several production-ready features:\n\n- **Advanced Capabilities**: TorchServe supports a wide array of advanced features, including dynamic batching, microbatching, model A/B testing, streaming, torch XLA, tensorRT, ONNX and IPEX. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates PyTorch's large model solution, PiPPy, enabling efficient handling of large models. Additionally, TorchServe extends its support to popular open-source libraries like DeepSpeed, Accelerate, Fast Transformers, and more, expanding its capabilities even further.\n\n- **Latency Optimization**: The job ticket feature is recommended for the use case of latency sensitive inference. When job ticket is enabled, TorchServe verifies the availability of a model's active worker for processing a client's request. If an active worker is available, the request is accepted and processed immediately without the waiting time incurred from the job queue or dynamic batching; otherwise, a 503 response is sent back to the client. This feature helps with use cases where inference latency can be high, such as generative models, auto regressive decoder models like chatGPT.\n\n- **Large Model Support**: For large model inference the model needs to be split over multiple GPUs. There are different modes to achieve this split which usually include pipeline parallel (PP), tensor parallel or a combination of these.\n\n## Cloud Integration\n\nIt comes with a convenient CLI to deploy locally and is easy to package into a container and scale out with Amazon SageMaker or Amazon EKS.(no content)With TorchServe, AWS users can confidently deploy and serve their PyTorch models, taking advantage of its versatility and optimized performance across various hardware configurations and model types.\n\n## Monitoring and Metrics\n\nYou can use the TorchServe central metrics config file metrics.yaml to specify the types of metrics to be tracked, such as request counts, latency, memory usage, GPU utilization, and more. By referring to this file, you can gain insights into the performance and health of the deployed models and effectively monitor the TorchServe server's behavior in real-time.\n\nThe combination of TorchServe's streaming capabilities with time series transformer models provides a robust solution for production deployment, though the iterative nature of time series inference may require careful optimization for performance-critical applications."}]},"uuid":"569fc316-a8c2-46d8-99aa-b4845f09613d","timestamp":"2025-07-23T19:22:59.232Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"PyTorch TorchServe streaming inference time series transformer production deployment","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BrQvTKSFHgiz69pZCBeN1m","content":[{"title":"How to run inference with a PyTorch time series Transformer | Towards Data Science","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-run-inference-with-a-pytorch-time-series-transformer-394fd6cbe16c/"},{"title":"Serving large models with Torchserve ‚Äî PyTorch/Serve master documentation","url":"https://docs.pytorch.org/serve/large_model_inference.html"},{"title":"TorchServe ‚Äî PyTorch/Serve master documentation","url":"https://docs.pytorch.org/serve/"},{"title":"Deploying PyTorch models for inference at scale using TorchServe | Artificial Intelligence","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploying-pytorch-models-for-inference-at-scale-using-torchserve/"},{"title":"Serving PyTorch models with TorchServe","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/serving-pytorch-models-with-torchserve-6b8e8cbdb632"},{"title":"Releases ¬∑ pytorch/serve","url":"https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases"},{"title":"TorchServe: Increasing inference speed while improving efficiency - deployment - PyTorch Developer Mailing List","url":"https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchserve-increasing-inference-speed-while-improving-efficiency/1194"},{"title":"TorchServe inference stream response support ¬∑ Issue #2234 ¬∑ pytorch/serve","url":"https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/2234"},{"title":"Deploy models with TorchServe - Amazon SageMaker AI","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deploy-models-frameworks-torchserve.html"},{"title":"Time Series Transformer","url":"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/time_series_transformer"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of PyTorch TorchServe streaming inference for time series transformer production deployment:\n\n## TorchServe Overview\n\nTorchServe is a performant, flexible and easy to use tool for serving PyTorch models in production.(no content)With TorchServe, you can deploy PyTorch models in either eager or graph mode using TorchScript, serve multiple models simultaneously, version production models for A/B testing, load and unload models dynamically, and monitor detailed logs and customizable metrics.\n\n## Streaming Inference Capabilities\n\nTorchServe supports streaming response for both HTTP and GRPC endpoint.

It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes forecasting, time series classification, clustering, anomaly/changepoint detection, and other tasks.(no content)It comes with time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools to build, tune, and validate time series models.\n\n## Key Features for Production Pipelines\n\n### Pipelining Capabilities\nPipelining: an extension of the scikit-learn Pipeline, which is a series of concatenated transformers to build a single forecaster. Rich model composition and reduction functionality -- build tuning and feature extraction pipelines, solve forecasting tasks with scikit-learn regressors.\n\n### Integration with Scikit-learn\nSktime is a library that lets you safely use any scikit-learn compatible regression model for time series forecasting.(no content)sktime also provides interfaces to related libraries, for example scikit-learn, statsmodels, tsfresh, PyOD, and fbprophet, among others.\n\n## Feature Engineering and Transformations\n\n### Built-in Transformations\nThe sktime.transformations module contains classes for data transformations. Series-to-features transformers transform individual time series to a collection of primitive features. Primitive features are usually a vector of floats, but can also be categorical.\n\n### Custom Feature Extraction\nIn this tutorial, we show how you can use sktime with tsfresh to first extract features from time series, so that we can then use any scikit-learn estimator. The library supports integration with tsfresh for automated feature extraction.\n\n### Time Series to Tabular Conversion\nSktime's make_reduction function transforms the time series into tabular data compatible with our scikit-learn estimator. The parameter, 'window_length', controls the number of lags in our sliding window transformation.\n\n## Building Complex Pipelines\n\n### Pipeline Examples\nHere's how you can create sophisticated time series pipelines:\n\n```python\n# Feature extraction pipeline with tsfresh\nclassifier = make_pipeline(\n    TSFreshFeatureExtractor(default_fc_parameters=\"efficient\", show_warnings=False),\n    RandomForestClassifier(),\n)\n```\n\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.compose import ColumnConcatenator from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier from sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinesteps = [ ('concatenate', ColumnConcatenator()), ('classify', TimeSeriesForestClassifier(**config['model_params'])) ] clf = Pipeline(steps)\n\n### Forecasting Pipelines\nforecaster = make_reduction( regressor, scitype=\"time-series-regressor\", window_length=12 )\n\n## Production Considerations\n\n### Data Preparation Tools\nIt provides many times series data preparation tools such as a train/test split data leakage free function.\n\n### Automated Feature Extraction\nSince Scikit-learn package requires data in a tabular structured way sktime propose also pipeline steps to automatically extract features from your time series to be treated by ensemble algorithms.\n\n### Multi-step Forecasting\nFurthermore, the make_reduction function has an input 'strategy', which controls how the forecaster generates its predictions.

It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes forecasting, time series classification, clustering, anomaly/changepoint detection, and other tasks.(no content)It comes with time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools to build, tune, and validate time series models.\n\n## Key Features for Production Pipelines\n\n### Pipelining Capabilities\nPipelining: an extension of the scikit-learn Pipeline, which is a series of concatenated transformers to build a single forecaster. Rich model composition and reduction functionality -- build tuning and feature extraction pipelines, solve forecasting tasks with scikit-learn regressors.\n\n### Integration with Scikit-learn\nSktime is a library that lets you safely use any scikit-learn compatible regression model for time series forecasting.(no content)sktime also provides interfaces to related libraries, for example scikit-learn, statsmodels, tsfresh, PyOD, and fbprophet, among others.\n\n## Feature Engineering and Transformations\n\n### Built-in Transformations\nThe sktime.transformations module contains classes for data transformations. Series-to-features transformers transform individual time series to a collection of primitive features. Primitive features are usually a vector of floats, but can also be categorical.\n\n### Custom Feature Extraction\nIn this tutorial, we show how you can use sktime with tsfresh to first extract features from time series, so that we can then use any scikit-learn estimator. The library supports integration with tsfresh for automated feature extraction.\n\n### Time Series to Tabular Conversion\nSktime's make_reduction function transforms the time series into tabular data compatible with our scikit-learn estimator. The parameter, 'window_length', controls the number of lags in our sliding window transformation.\n\n## Building Complex Pipelines\n\n### Pipeline Examples\nHere's how you can create sophisticated time series pipelines:\n\n```python\n# Feature extraction pipeline with tsfresh\nclassifier = make_pipeline(\n    TSFreshFeatureExtractor(default_fc_parameters=\"efficient\", show_warnings=False),\n    RandomForestClassifier(),\n)\n```\n\nfrom sktime.transformations.panel.compose import ColumnConcatenator from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier from sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinesteps = [ ('concatenate', ColumnConcatenator()), ('classify', TimeSeriesForestClassifier(**config['model_params'])) ] clf = Pipeline(steps)\n\n### Forecasting Pipelines\nforecaster = make_reduction( regressor, scitype=\"time-series-regressor\", window_length=12 )\n\n## Production Considerations\n\n### Data Preparation Tools\nIt provides many times series data preparation tools such as a train/test split data leakage free function.\n\n### Automated Feature Extraction\nSince Scikit-learn package requires data in a tabular structured way sktime propose also pipeline steps to automatically extract features from your time series to be treated by ensemble algorithms.\n\n### Multi-step Forecasting\nFurthermore, the make_reduction function has an input 'strategy', which controls how the forecaster generates its predictions. The parameter is relevant when we are making more than one-step ahead forecasts. In our example, we are making predictions for the next 26 weeks of pedestrian counts (multi-step) rather than just the following week (one-step).\n\n## Evaluation and Model Assessment\nEvaluation: sktime includes several performance metrics (e.g. MAPE, MASE) and provides an easy implementation for custom scorers and backtesting. Fair model assessment and benchmarking -- build your models, inspect your models, check your models, and avoid pitfalls.\n\n## Community and Ecosystem\nEmbedded in state-of-art ecosystems and provider of interoperable interfaces -- interoperable with scikit-learn, statsmodels, tsfresh, and other community favorites.\n\nThe search results show that sktime provides a comprehensive framework for building production-ready time series pipelines with extensive feature engineering capabilities, custom transformations, and seamless integration with the broader Python data science ecosystem."],"durationSeconds":30.46722079199995}}

This enables the automatic creation of complex patterns for machine learning.(no content)The name Deep Feature Synthesis comes from the algorithm's ability to stack primitives to generate more complex features. Each time we stack a primitive we increase the \"depth\" of a feature. The max_depth parameter controls the maximum depth of the features returned by DFS.\n\n**Relational Data Handling**: It works across multiple related tables and applies various transformations for feature generation. The entire process is carried out using a technique called \"Deep Feature Synthesis\" (DFS) which recursively applies transformations across entity sets to generate complex features.\n\n## Time Series Feature Engineering\n\nFeaturetools can be used for automating feature engineering for univariate time series problems, or problems in which only the time index and target column are included. The library provides specific capabilities for temporal data:\n\n**Rolling Primitives**: Featuretools has several rolling primitives with which we can achieve this. Here, we'll use the RollingMean and RollingMin primitives, setting the gap and window_length accordingly.\n\n**Temporal Data Leakage Prevention**: DFS in Featuretools can automatically calculate the features for each training example at the specific time associated with the example by using \"cutoff times.\" It accomplishes this by simulating what the raw data looked like at a past point in time in order to perform feature engineering on the valid data.\n\n## Streaming Data Applications\n\nThe search results mention applications with \"pre-processed movie streaming and user data from Kafka streams and APIs\" as part of CMU Machine Learning in Production course.(no content)This tool is especially useful for MLOps, which is all about making sure machine learning can work well not just once, but all the time and as part of bigger systems. Featuretools helps by making sure that the part where we tell the machine what to learn from is done the same way every time, which is important for keeping things running smoothly when we use machine learning in the real world.\n\n## Practical Benefits\n\nAutomating feature engineering optimizes the process of building and deploying accurate machine learning models by handling necessary but tedious tasks so data scientists can focus more on other important steps.(no content)DFS can be used to develop baseline models with little human intervention. However, the automation of feature engineering should be thought of as a complement to critical human expertise ‚Äî it enables data scientists to be more precise and productive.\n\nThe library has become quite popular, with Featuretools being taught to nearly 1000 people in MIT's online Data Science and Big Data Analytics course and becoming the most popular library for feature engineering on Github."}]},"uuid":"bc2fb4ae-18cd-4567-9b23-5892eb525f42","timestamp":"2025-07-23T19:23:52.976Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"featuretools automated feature engineering streaming time series deep feature synthesis","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01LejddUVJHEDQpK9k8W12K3","content":[{"title":"Deep Feature Synthesis ‚Äî Featuretools 0.16.0 documentation","url":"https://docs.featuretools.com/en/v0.16.0/automated_feature_engineering/afe.html"},{"title":"Feature Engineering for Time Series Problems ‚Äî Featuretools 1.31.0 documentation","url":"https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/v1.31.0/guides/time_series.html"},{"title":"Deep Feature Synthesis ‚Äî Featuretools 1.31.0 documentation","url":"https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/getting_started/afe.html"},{"title":"Automated Feature Engineering Tutorial | Kaggle","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/code/willkoehrsen/automated-feature-engineering-tutorial"},{"title":"Deep Feature Synthesis: How Automated Feature Engineering Works - KDnuggets","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/deep-feature-synthesis-automated-feature-engineering.html"},{"title":"Intro to Featuretools: Streamlining Feature Engineering | by valerieyuan | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@valerievic17528/intro-to-featuretools-streamlining-feature-engineering-725b9e03566b"},{"title":"The Best Feature Engineering Tools","url":"https://neptune.ai/blog/feature-engineering-tools"},{"title":"Automated Feature Engineering with FeatureTools - Hopsworks","url":"https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/automated-feature-engineering-with-featuretools"},{"title":"Tuning Deep Feature Synthesis ‚Äî Featuretools 0.15.0 documentation","url":"https://docs.featuretools.com/en/v0.15.0/guides/tuning_dfs.html"},{"title":"Deep Feature Synthesis: How Automated Feature Engineering Works","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-feature-synthesis-how-engineering-automation-works-max-kanter"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about featuretools, automated feature engineering, streaming time series, and Deep Feature Synthesis:\n\n## Featuretools and Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS)\n\nDeep Feature Synthesis (DFS) is an automated method for performing feature engineering on relational and temporal data.(no content)DFS was developed in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab alongside Kalyan Veeramachaneni in 2014, where it was used to create the \"Data Science Machine\" to automatically build predictive models for complex, multi-table datasets and to compete in online data science competitions where they beat 615 out of 906 human teams.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n**Automated Feature Generation**: Stacking results in features that are more expressive than individual primitives themselves.

To do that with tsfresh you will have to use a custom settings object through the `ComprehensiveFCParameters()` class.\n\n### Kind-Specific Feature Parameters\nIt is also possible to control the features to be extracted for the different kinds of time series individually. You can do so by passing a kind_to_fc_parameters parameter to the tsfresh.extract_features() function.

It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The forecasting models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn.\n\n## PyTorch and Lightning Integration\nAll deep learning models are implemented using PyTorch Lightning, supporting among other things custom callbacks, GPUs/TPUs training and custom trainers.(no content)In Darts, Torch Forecasting Models (TFMs) are broadly speaking \"machine learning based\" models, which denote PyTorch-based (deep learning) models.\n\n## Transformer Models\nDarts includes several transformer-based architectures:\n\n1. **Standard Transformer Model**: Transformer is a state-of-the-art deep learning model introduced in 2017. It is an encoder-decoder architecture whose core feature is the 'multi-head attention' mechanism, which is able to draw intra-dependencies within the input vector and within the...\n\n2. **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**: Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting. This is an implementation of the TFT architecture, as outlined in [1].(no content)This model supports past covariates (known for input_chunk_length points before prediction time), future covariates (known for output_chunk_length points after prediction time), static covariates, as well as probabilistic forecasting.\n\n## Production Deployment\nDeploying a Darts forecasting model on Amazon SageMaker is demonstrated in the search results. Since the BlockRNN model in darts is implemented using PyTorch, we'll use the PyTorch container provided by SageMaker (with their model server on it) and install Darts on it. The container will pip install the contents of the ./model/code/requirements.txt file we'll give SageMaker, so we save the exact darts, torch, torchmetrics and pytorch-lightning versions used for training to the file.\n\nFor real-time inference: Clearly, endpoints are suitable for real-time forecasts, and async endpoints for large-scale forecasts with more input data. Both follow a very similar deployment process, so we'll deploy to a provisioned endpoint below.\n\n## Global Models and Multi-Series Training\nAll the deep learning forecasting models implemented in Darts as well as RegressionModel are global forecasting models. This means that these models can be trained on multiple series, and can forecast future values of any time series, even series that are not contained in the training set.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n- Darts has a strong support for deep learning models. These models provide richer functionalities, such as the ability to be trained on multiple series and covariates. This can simply be done by calling fit() with sequences of TimeSeries instead of unique TimeSeries. It can scale to large datasets and use GPUs.\n\nThe library appears to be actively maintained by Unit8 and provides a comprehensive solution for time series forecasting with modern deep learning approaches, including transformer architectures and production deployment capabilities."}]},"uuid":"ae8a695e-0082-4b99-a408-1ca896e1d288","timestamp":"2025-07-23T19:24:40.495Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"PyTorch forecasting Darts unit8 production deployment streaming seq2seq transformers","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0166z8Rd9y5p8jCdjXL6WrZW","content":[{"title":"Torch Forecasting Models ‚Äî darts documentation","url":"https://unit8co.github.io/darts/userguide/torch_forecasting_models.html"},{"title":"Transformer Model ‚Äî darts documentation","url":"https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.transformer_model.html"},{"title":"Darts, open-source tool - Unit8","url":"https://unit8.com/resources/darts-time-series-made-easy-in-python/"},{"title":"Time Series Made Easy in Python ‚Äî darts documentation","url":"https://unit8co.github.io/darts/"},{"title":"GitHub - unit8co/darts: A python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series.","url":"https://github.com/unit8co/darts"},{"title":"Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) ‚Äî darts documentation","url":"https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.tft_model.html"},{"title":"Darts open-source, time series forecasting, anomaly detection | Unit8","url":"https://unit8.com/darts-open-source/"},{"title":"Training Forecasting Models with Darts | Unit8","url":"https://unit8.com/resources/training-forecasting-models/"},{"title":"Demand forecasting with the Temporal Fusion Transformer ‚Äî pytorch-forecasting documentation","url":"https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/stallion.html"},{"title":"Throwing Darts at SageMaker.

This approach leverages the same unified language (Python/Scala) and framework (Apache Spark) shared by data scientists, data engineers and analysts, allowing multiple teams to reason about user data using familiar Dataset / DataFrame APIs and abstractions.\n\n## MLflow 3 Production Deployment Capabilities\n\nMLflow 3 on Databricks allows you to centrally track and analyze the performance of your models, AI applications, and agents across all environments, from interactive queries in a development notebook through production batch or real-time serving deployments.\n\n### Model Serving Framework\n\nModels can be served as REST APIs or run high-throughput batch inference with ai_query‚Äîoptimized for both CPU and GPU via Mosaic AI Model Serving. Databricks Model Serving is tightly integrated with MLflow Model Registry and provides a unified, scalable interface for deploying, governing, and querying AI models. Each model you serve is available as a REST API that you can integrate into web or client applications.\n\n### Streaming Inference Architecture\n\nFor real-time streaming inference, the typical architecture includes:\n\n1. **Data Streaming**: Enrich Spark Structured Streaming micro-batches of raw event data with real-time features from feature stores\n\n2. **Model Training & Logging**: With MLflow, register models and log their performance across different experiment runs from within the Databricks Notebook interface\n\n3. **Model Deployment**: MLflow model images are ultimately pushed to container registries and deployed onto model endpoints\n\n4. **Real-time Processing**: Use lightweight functions to unpack/pack data in appropriate messaging formats, invoke the actual model endpoints and perform any required post-processing and persistence\n\n## Production Deployment Frameworks\n\n### Multiple Deployment Targets\n\nDatabricks provides a managed service for delivering MLflow models at scale, including performance optimization and monitoring tools. MLflow deployment interfaces with Kubernetes-native ML serving frameworks, including Seldon Core and KServe.\n\n### Batch vs. Streaming Inference\n\nThe inference pipeline reads the latest data from the production catalog, executes functions to compute on-demand features, loads the \"Champion\" model, scores the data, and returns predictions. Batch or streaming inference is generally the most cost-effective option for higher throughput, higher latency use cases.\n\n### Model Versioning and Deployment Patterns\n\nThe registered model in Unity Catalog is referenced by its alias.

This approach leverages the same unified language (Python/Scala) and framework (Apache Spark) shared by data scientists, data engineers and analysts, allowing multiple teams to reason about user data using familiar Dataset / DataFrame APIs and abstractions.\n\n## MLflow 3 Production Deployment Capabilities\n\nMLflow 3 on Databricks allows you to centrally track and analyze the performance of your models, AI applications, and agents across all environments, from interactive queries in a development notebook through production batch or real-time serving deployments.\n\n### Model Serving Framework\n\nModels can be served as REST APIs or run high-throughput batch inference with ai_query‚Äîoptimized for both CPU and GPU via Mosaic AI Model Serving. Databricks Model Serving is tightly integrated with MLflow Model Registry and provides a unified, scalable interface for deploying, governing, and querying AI models. Each model you serve is available as a REST API that you can integrate into web or client applications.\n\n### Streaming Inference Architecture\n\nFor real-time streaming inference, the typical architecture includes:\n\n1. **Data Streaming**: Enrich Spark Structured Streaming micro-batches of raw event data with real-time features from feature stores\n\n2. **Model Training & Logging**: With MLflow, register models and log their performance across different experiment runs from within the Databricks Notebook interface\n\n3. **Model Deployment**: MLflow model images are ultimately pushed to container registries and deployed onto model endpoints\n\n4. **Real-time Processing**: Use lightweight functions to unpack/pack data in appropriate messaging formats, invoke the actual model endpoints and perform any required post-processing and persistence\n\n## Production Deployment Frameworks\n\n### Multiple Deployment Targets\n\nDatabricks provides a managed service for delivering MLflow models at scale, including performance optimization and monitoring tools. MLflow deployment interfaces with Kubernetes-native ML serving frameworks, including Seldon Core and KServe.\n\n### Batch vs. Streaming Inference\n\nThe inference pipeline reads the latest data from the production catalog, executes functions to compute on-demand features, loads the \"Champion\" model, scores the data, and returns predictions. Batch or streaming inference is generally the most cost-effective option for higher throughput, higher latency use cases.\n\n### Model Versioning and Deployment Patterns\n\nThe registered model in Unity Catalog is referenced by its alias. The inference pipeline is configured to load and apply the \"Champion\" model version. If the \"Champion\" version is updated to a new model version, the inference pipeline automatically uses the new version for its next execution.\n\n## Advanced Features for Production\n\n### Enhanced Performance\nThe MLflow inference server has been migrated from Flask to FastAPI, enabling ASGI-based scalable inference for improved performance and throughput.\n\n### Monitoring and Observability\nModel Serving heavily relies on MLflow Model Registry to handle model versioning, dependency management, validation, and governance.

This is a popular structure for dealing with the notoriously difficult problem of accurate time series forecasting. Several key implementations are available:\n\n**TensorFlow-based Solutions:**\n- tfts: Time Series Deep Learning Models in TensorFlow - LongxingTan/Time-series-prediction with TFTS-Bert wins the 3rd place in KDD Cup 2022-wind power forecasting ¬∑ TFTS-Seq2seq wins the 4th place in Tianchi-ENSO index prediction 2021\n- Seq2seq Model on Time-series Data: Training and Serving with TensorFlow which also perform very well on numerical, time-series data which is of particular interest in finance and IoT, among others.\n\n**PyTorch Solutions:**\n- The model is used to forecast multiple time-series (around 10K time-series), sort of like predicting the sales of each product in each store. I don't want the overhead of training multiple models, so deep learning looked like a good choice.\n\n## Production-Ready Streaming Infrastructure\n\n### Data Streaming Platforms\nTop Trends for Data Streaming with Apache Kafka and Flink in 2025 indicates that Today, most enterprises are realizing the value of data streaming for both analytical and operational use cases\n\n**Apache Kafka & Flink:**\n- Apache Flink continues to push the boundaries of real-time stream processing, and its latest 2.0 release (March 2025) brings significant upgrades in performance, scalability, and developer experience.\n- Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform that has revolutionized the way we process streaming data and Apache Kafka handles vast amounts of data streams with minimal latency and can ingest data from multiple sources.\n\n### Time Series Databases for Enterprise\n**InfluxDB 3 Enterprise (2025):**\nInfluxData, creator of the leading time series database, today announced the general availability of InfluxDB 3 Core and InfluxDB 3 Enterprise, the latest products developed on its redesigned InfluxDB 3 engine. Built for rapid development and large-scale production, Core and Enterprise provide a high-performance, easily scalable database for managing time series data.(no content)InfluxDB 3 Enterprise adds high availability, enhanced security, and scalability for production environments. Both bring data transformation, enrichment, and alerting directly into the database with a built-in Python Processing Engine, elevating InfluxDB from passive storage to an active intelligence engine for real-time data.\n\n**TimeBase Enterprise:**\nTimeBase Enterprise Edition is a high-performance time series database software that is a high-performance time-series database, streaming and messaging system. It has over 15 years of product history and hundreds of clients, including industry-leading banks, brokers and hedge funds.\n\n## Enterprise ML Deployment Frameworks\n\n### MLOps Platforms\n**Kubeflow:**\nKubeflow makes deployment of ML Workflows on Kubernetes straightforward and automated with Kubeflow Trainer is a Kubernetes-native project for fine-tuning LLMs and model training. It enables scalable and distributed training with various frameworks including PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and more.\n\n**TensorFlow Extended (TFX):**\nTFX is a production-scale machine learning platform based on Tensorflow.

They specifically mention Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Maureen O'Hara, Riccardo Rebonato, Petter Kolm, Campbell R. Harvey, and Marcos L√≥pez de Prado - these are all highly respected quantitative finance researchers and practitioners.\n\nThey want recommendations for parameter-less, magic number-free features or indicators that would be better for algorithmic model development, specifically in the context of seq2seq streaming time series forecasting that we've been discussing.\n\nLet me think about what these quant leaders would focus on:\n\n1. **Jean-Philippe Bouchaud** - Known for statistical physics approaches to finance, market microstructure, and criticisms of traditional financial models. He'd focus on data-driven, empirical approaches without arbitrary parameters.\n\n2. **Maureen O'Hara** - Expert in market microstructure, would focus on the structural aspects of data and market mechanisms.\n\n3. **Riccardo Rebonato** - Risk management expert, would emphasize robust, parameter-free risk measures.\n\n4. **Petter Kolm** - Machine learning in finance, would focus on adaptive, data-driven approaches.\n\n5. **Campbell R. Harvey** - Factor investing and research methodology, would emphasize rigorous statistical approaches.\n\n6. **Marcos L√≥pez de Prado** - Machine learning for asset management, would focus on information-theoretic and structural approaches.\n\nThe key themes these quants would emphasize:\n- Parameter-free, data-adaptive methods\n- Information-theoretic approaches\n- Structural/mechanistic understanding\n- Robustness to regime changes\n- Avoiding overfitting and spurious patterns\n- Focus on invariant properties\n- Causal rather than correlational relationships\n\nFor seq2seq streaming time series, they would likely recommend:\n\n1. **Information-theoretic features** - Measures like mutual information, transfer entropy, complexity measures that adapt to the data\n\n\n2. **Structural invariants** capture fundamental market dynamics independent of specific regimes. These could include topological features that remain consistent across different market conditions.\n\n3. **Non-parametric techniques** leverage data-driven approaches that eliminate arbitrary parameter selection. Machine learning algorithms that dynamically adjust to underlying data structures would be preferred.\n\n4. **Causal inference methods** go beyond simple correlational relationships, focusing on understanding true directional dependencies in financial time series.\n\n5. **Adaptive complexity measures** dynamically assess the information content and complexity of time series, providing insights that traditional static metrics cannot capture.\n\n6. **Ensemble approaches** combine multiple parameter-free techniques to create more robust and reliable predictive models.\n\n7. **Information geometric techniques** explore the underlying manifold of financial data, revealing intrinsic structural properties.\n\n8. **Fractional differentiation** preserves long-memory
